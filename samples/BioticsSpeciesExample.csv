However, the only significant difference between the two taxa is size, with <i>S. gaspensis</i> smaller than <i>S. dispar</i> (Kirkland and Van Deusen 1979, French and Kirkland 1983). Yet <i>Sorex dispar</i> exhibits a south to north decreasing cline in body size, suggesting the possibility that <i>S. gaspensis</i> is not a distinct species (e.g., Scott and van Zyll de Jong 1989) but rather simply represents the northern extent of the <i>S. dispar</i> cline. Accordingly, Rhymer et al.

Additionally, using mtDNA d-loop sequences, Rhymer et al.

However, surveys to verify occurrences since the last record in 1953 have been too infrequent and are insufficient to draw any conclusions about extent of occurrence, population size, threats, or trends.
