The loss of subpopulations on some smaller islands was probably due to habitat destruction from overabundant Double–crested Cormorants, which colonized the islands in the early 1980s, as well as human activities. Habitat loss and alteration on Pelee Island likely led to subpopulation declines and fragmentation. Climate change is the most serious threat.
