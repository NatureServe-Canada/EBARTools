"Yes (the element is endemic)","endemic to a single nation","Hall","1981.0","100179.0","N","National endemic, known from Labrador and Quebec.","Taxonomy of <i>Dicrostonyx </i>is complex and unstable. <i>Dicrostonyx hudsonius</i> was regarded as part of a single circumpolar species, <i>D. torquatus</i>, until the 1970s when karyological and breeding studies indicated the possible existence of a superspecies complex among North American <i>Dicrostonyx</i> (Rausch and Rausch 1972, Rausch 1977; see also Krohne 1982). Former subspecies occurring in Canada and Alaska were recognized as separate species based mainly on karyotypes (Rausch and Rausch 1972, Rausch 1977, Krohne 1982, Honacki et al. 1982, Baker et al. 2003). Jarrell and Fredga (1993) and Engstrom (1999) suggested treating <i>D. hudsonius</i>, <i>D. richardsoni</i>, and <i>D. groenlandicus</i> as distinct species (the latter including the other North American <i>Dicrostonyx </i>populations as subspecies), and molecular data (Fedorov and Goropashnaya 1999) supports this taxonomy. Musser and Carleton (in Wilson and Reeder 2005) reviewed these and subsequent studies and recognized eight <i>Dicrostonyx </i>species, six of which (<i>groenlandicus</i>, <i>hudsonius</i>, <i>nelsoni</i>, <i>nunatakensis</i>, <i>richardsoni</i>, and <i>unalascensis</i>) occur in North America. Baker et al. (2003) recognized <i>D. exsul</i>, <i>D. kilangmiutak</i>, and <i>D. rubricatus</i> as species, but Musser and Carleton recognized <i>exsul </i>as a synonym of <i>D. nelsoni</i>, and <i>kilangmiutak </i>and <i>rubricatus </i>were treated as synonyms of <i>D. groenlandicus</i>. Fedorov and Stenseth (2002) followed Fedorov and Goropashnaya (1999) in recognizing three North American <i>Dicrostonyx </i>species.","2-100179","163439.0","AMAFF18020","Standard","Vertebrate Animal","Mammals","Terrestrial","Craniata","","Dicrostonyx","Dicrostonyx hudsonius","Ungava Collared Lemming","Lemming d'Ungava,  Lemming à collerette du Labrador","","Species","Dicrostonyx hudsonius","Ungava Collared Lemming","Lemming d'Ungava;  Lemming à collerette du Labrador","G4G5","G4","2018-01-01","2018-01-01","N4N5","N4","2018-01-01","2018-01-01","","","","","","","","","","LC","Native","Regularly occurring","Confident","Present","Year-round","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","LB, QC","Y","CA(N4N5)",""
