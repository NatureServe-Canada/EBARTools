Herbs are usually sparse but graminoids include <i>Schizachyrium scoparium, Deschampsia flexuosa</i>, and <i>Danthona spicata.</i> Fire is a very important ecological process in this group. Frequent, low-intensity fires coupled with periodic severe fires is one factor that determines the occurrence of this vegetation rather than hardwood forests under natural conditions. The pines may be able to maintain dominance due to edaphic conditions, such as very shallow soil or extreme exposure in some areas, which can produce sustained drought conditions, but most sites appear eventually to succeed to oak dominance in the absence of fire. Fire can influence vegetation structure, producing a more open woodland canopy structure and more herbaceous ground cover. Stands typically occur at moderate to upper elevations (450-1200 m [1500-4000 feet]), but some examples may be found at lower elevations. The underlying rock is acidic and sedimentary or metasedimentary (e.g., quartzites, sandstones and shales). The soils are very infertile, shallow and droughty.

It also occurs east across Idaho into the eastern foothills of the Montana Rockies.

The former are generally fire-maintained, while the later are often too dry and with widely spaced vegetation to carry fire. <i>Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa</i> is the predominant conifer; <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> or <i>Pinus flexilis</i> may be present in the tree canopy but are usually absent. The understory can be shrubby, with <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Arctostaphylos patula, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Artemisia tridentata, Cercocarpus ledifolius, Physocarpus malvaceus, Purshia tridentata, Rosa</i> spp., <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>, or <i>Symphoricarpos oreophilus</i> as common species. In transition areas with sagebrush steppe, <i>Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata, Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis, Artemisia tripartita</i>, and <i>Purshia tridentata</i> may be common in fire-protected sites such as rocky areas. Deciduous shrubs, such as <i>Physocarpus malvaceus, Spiraea betulifolia</i>, or <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>, can be abundant in more northerly sites or more moist climates. Herbaceous vegetation in the true savanna occurrences is predominantly fire-resistant grasses and forbs that resprout following surface fires; shrubs, understory trees and downed logs are uncommon. These more open stands support grasses such as <i>Achnatherum</i> spp., dry <i>Carex</i> species (<i>Carex inops</i>), <i>Elymus elymoides, Festuca campestris, Festuca idahoensis, Hesperostipa</i> spp., or <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>. These woodlands and savannas occur at the lower treeline/ecotone between grasslands or shrublands and more mesic coniferous forests, typically on warm, dry, exposed sites. These interior Pacific Northwest woodlands receive winter and spring rains, and thus have a greater spring ""green-up"" than the drier woodlands in the Central Rockies. However, sites are often too droughty to support a closed tree canopy. Elevations range from less than 500 m in British Columbia to 1600 m in the central Idaho mountains. Occurrences are found on all slopes and aspects; however, moderately steep to very steep slopes or ridgetops and plateaus are most common. This group generally occurs on most geological substrates from weathered rock to glacial deposits to eolian deposits. Characteristic soil features include good aeration and drainage, coarse textures, circumneutral to slightly acidic pH, an abundance of mineral material, and periods of drought during the growing season. Some occurrences may occur as edaphic climax communities on very skeletal, infertile and/or excessively drained soils, such as pumice, cinder or lava fields, and scree slopes. Surface textures are highly variable in this group, ranging from sand to loam and silt loam. Exposed rock and bare soil consistently occur to some degree in all the associations. The more mesic portions of this group may include <i>Calamagrostis rubescens</i> or <i>Carex geyeri</i>, species more typical of ~Central Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir - Pine Forest Group (G210)$$. Mixed fire regimes and surface fires of variable return intervals maintain these woodlands, typically with a shrub-dominated or patchy shrub layer, depending on climate, degree of soil development, and understory density.

In the eastern Cascades, <i>Pinus contorta</i> may be the codominant pine, rather than <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>. The nature of this forest group is a matrix of large patches dominated or codominated by one or combinations of the above species; <i>Abies grandis</i> (a fire-sensitive, shade-tolerant species not occurring in central Montana) has increased on many sites once dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, which were formerly maintained by low-severity wildfire. Understories are typically dominated by graminoids, such as <i>Calamagrostis rubescens, Carex geyeri, Carex rossii</i>, and <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>, and a variety of shrubs, such as <i>Acer glabrum, Juniperus communis, Physocarpus malvaceus, Spiraea betulifolia, Symphoricarpos albus</i>, or <i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i> on mesic sites. <i>Abies concolor</i> and <i>Abies grandis x concolor</i> hybrids in central Idaho (the Salmon Mountains) may occur in some stands, but have very restricted ranges in this area. <i>Abies concolor</i> and <i>Abies grandis</i> in the Blue Mountains of Oregon are probably hybrids of the two and mostly <i>Abies grandis</i>.

Presettlement fire regimes may have been characterized by frequent, low-intensity surface fires that maintained relatively open stands of a mix of fire-resistant species. Under present conditions the fire regime is mixed-severity and more variable, with stand-replacing fires more common, and the forests are more homogeneous. With vigorous fire suppression, longer fire-return intervals are now prevalent, and multi-layered stands of <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus ponderosa</i>, and/or <i>Abies grandis</i> provide fuel ""ladders,"" making these forests more susceptible to high-intensity, stand-replacing fires.

It extends westward into the northeastern side of Mount Rainier in Washington, and as far east as mountain ""islands"" of north-central Montana. <i>Picea engelmannii</i> is generally more important in southern forests than those in the Pacific Northwest. Occurrences are typically found in locations with cold-air drainage or ponding, or where snowpacks linger late into the summer, such as north-facing slopes and high-elevation ravines. They can extend down in elevation below the subalpine zone in places where cold-air ponding occurs; northerly and easterly aspects predominate. These forests are found on gentle to very steep mountain slopes, high-elevation ridgetops and upper slopes, plateaulike surfaces, basins, alluvial terraces, well-drained benches, and inactive stream terraces. In the northern Rocky Mountains of northern Idaho and Montana, <i>Tsuga mertensiana</i> occurs as small to large patches within the matrix of this mesic spruce-fir group and only in the most maritime of environments (the coldest and wettest of the more Continental subalpine fir forests). In parts of the northern Cascades, the climate is more maritime than typical for this group, but due to the lower snowfall in these rainshadow areas, summer drought may be more significant than snowpack in limiting tree regeneration in burned areas. <i>Picea engelmannii</i> is rare in these areas. <i>Populus tremuloides</i> is a common codominant tree in many disturbed stands. Moisture-loving understory species are diagnostic of this group and may include shrubs <i>Cornus canadensis, Ledum glandulosum</i> (rare), <i>Menziesia ferruginea, Phyllodoce empetriformis, Rhododendron albiflorum, Rubus parviflorus, Salix</i> spp. and <i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i>. The understory may also be dominated by mesic herbaceous species such as <i>Actaea rubra, Calamagrostis canadensis, Clintonia uniflora, Erigeron eximius, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Luzula glabrata var. hitchcockii, Maianthemum stellatum, Rubus pedatus, Saxifraga bronchialis, Thalictrum</i> spp., <i>Tiarella</i> spp., and <i>Valeriana sitchensis</i>. Disturbances include occasional blowdown, insect outbreaks (30-50 years), mixed-severity fire, and stand-replacing fire (every 150-500 years).

The climate is typically very cold and snowy in winter and relatively dry and cool in summer. The upper and lower elevational limits, due to climatic variability and differing topography, vary considerably; in interior British Columbia, this group occurs between 1400 and 2200 m elevation, and in northwestern Montana, it occurs up to 2400 m. Landforms include ridgetops, mountain slopes, glacial trough walls and moraines, talus slopes, landslides and rockslides, cirque headwalls and basins. Some sites have little snow accumulation because of high winds and sublimation. In this harsh, often windswept environment, trees are typically stunted and flagged from damage associated with wind, blowing snow and ice crystals, especially at the upper elevations of the type. The stands or patches often originate when <i>Pinus albicaulis</i>, and in some communities <i>Picea engelmannii</i>, colonize a sheltered site such as the lee side of a rock. <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> can then colonize in the shelter of either species.

Annual precipitation ranges from 975 to 2399 mm (38-94 inches) with an average of 1572 mm (62 inches) with the majority falling as winter rain. Summer rains are less frequent (&lt;10% of annual rainfall occurs in summer) which can be ameliorated by frequent, dense coastal fog and cloud cover.<br /><br />Stands are found mostly below 300 m in elevation, where the terrain is mostly gentle, of low topographic relief, and often rocky. Some stands occur on stabilized dunes, others in lower toeslopes and wet sites that are also well-drained, such as sloped floodplains (but are not influenced by overbank flooding) and coarse valley bottoms. Sites occupied include the outermost coastal fringe where salt spray is prominent, riparian terraces and valley bottoms near the coast where there is major fog accumulation. Soils typically have a distinct humus layer overlying mineral horizons or bedrock. In central British Columbia the humus layers can be very thick (mean = 17-35 cm). Soils are often imperfectly drained. These forests very rarely burn, and natural disturbance is more often single tree gap-disturbance events and intense winter storms on local and regional scales. Fire becomes more of a player in the southern portions of the range, in Oregon and California.","The CNVC concept CG0751 appears to be the same as this IVC concept (G751), so the CNVC type has been provisionally replaced with the IVC type in the CNVC.",1.B.2.Nd.1.f

Coldest monthly temperature range from -15° to -1°C (5-30°F). Stands ranges from sea level to about 1000 m (3000 feet) in elevation. These forests occur along a coastal belt on deep, acidic soils derived from marine sediments, but can also occur at higher elevations along stream channels, snow avalanche paths, mass-wasting slopes or loess deposits. In British Columbia, much of the hypermaritime band is shallow soils derived from acidic bedrock with deep organic accumulations due to hypermaritime climate. Glaciation resulted in a scouring of the landscape with little till accumulation. There are also pockets of richer bedrock that is reflected in the productivity of the stands.

It also appears in the adjacent Columbia Plateau ecoregion. Most occurrences of this group are dominated by a mix of <i>Quercus garryana</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>. Isolated, taller <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> over <i>Quercus garryana</i> trees characterize parts of this group. Clonal <i>Quercus garryana</i> can create dense patches across a grassy landscape or can dominate open woodlands or even savannas. The understory may include dense stands of shrubs or, more often, be dominated by grasses, sedges or forbs. Shrub-steppe shrubs may be prominent in some stands and create a distinct tree / shrub / sparse grassland habitat, including <i>Artemisia nova</i> (in Oregon only), <i>Artemisia tridentata, Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus</i>, and <i>Purshia tridentata</i>. Mesic sites have an open to closed sodgrass understory dominated by <i>Calamagrostis rubescens, Carex geyeri, Carex inops, Carex rossii</i>, or <i>Elymus glaucus</i>. Drier savanna and woodland understories typically contain bunchgrass steppe species such as <i>Festuca idahoensis</i> or <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>. Common exotic grasses that often appear in high abundance are <i>Bromus tectorum</i> and <i>Poa bulbosa</i>. Disjunct occurrences in the Klamath Mountains and southernmost Cascades typically have high cover of sagebrush and bitterbrush in the understory, along with other shrubs. In the Columbia River Gorge, this group appears as small to large patches in transitional areas in the Little White Salmon and White Salmon river drainages in Washington and Hood River, Rock Creek, Moiser Creek, Mill Creek, Threemile Creek, Fifteen Mile Creek, and White River drainages in Oregon. <i>Quercus garryana</i> can create dense patches often associated with grassland or shrubland balds within a closed <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forest landscape. Commonly the understory is shrubby and composed of <i>Ceanothus integerrimus, Holodiscus discolor, Symphoricarpos albus</i>, and <i>Toxicodendron diversilobum</i>. These woodlands occur at the lower treeline/ecotone between <i>Artemisia</i> spp. or <i>Purshia tridentata</i> steppe or shrubland and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> and/or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forest or woodland. Elevations range from 460 to 1920 m. Sites are typically warm with southern exposures with seasonal soil drought or desiccating winds. Substrates usually have bedrock, sand, or pumice soils which are excessively well-drained. Fire plays an important role in creating vegetation structure and composition in this habitat. Decades of fire suppression have led to invasion by <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> along lower treeline and by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> in the gorge and other oak patches on xeric sites in the east Cascade foothills. In the past, most of the habitat experienced frequent low-severity fires that maintained woodland or savanna conditions. The mean fire-return interval is 20 years, although variable. Soil drought plays a role, maintaining an open tree canopy in part of this dry woodland habitat.<br /><br />Westside: This group also occurs of the west side of the mountain ranges from the Cascades to the North Coast Ranges in California. It is limited to the southern portions of the North Pacific region where it occurs in southwestern British Columbia, in the Puget Trough and Willamette Valley south into the Klamath Mountains and into northern California, southward through the lower southern Cascades and western Modoc Plateau and the middle and inner North Coast Ranges into Mendocino County. The vegetation ranges from savanna and woodland to forest dominated by deciduous broadleaf trees, mostly <i>Quercus garryana</i>. Codominance by the evergreen conifer <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> is common, and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> is important in some stands. In the south, common associates also include <i>Quercus kelloggii</i> and <i>Arbutus menziesii</i>. The predominant oaks with the higher frequency fires include <i>Quercus kelloggii</i> and <i>Quercus garryana</i>, with <i>Quercus garryana var. garryana</i> codominant in the central and northern Coast Ranges, Klamath Mountains and Modoc Plateau. However, <i>Quercus garryana var. fruticosa</i> often codominates in the northwestern Coast Ranges. More isolated patches of shrubby, clonal <i>Quercus garryana var. semota</i> (similar to but apparently distinct from <i>var. fruticosa</i>) occur farther south into the Sierra Nevada southward to the Paiute and Tehachapi mountains (southern branches of the Sierra Nevada), but these are without <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and appear to behave more as montane chaparral stands. The perennial bunchgrass component includes <i>Danthonia californica</i> (close to the coast), <i>Elymus glaucus, Festuca californica</i>, and <i>Festuca idahoensis</i>. A variety of native forbs also occur. Other characteristic species include <i>Ceanothus cuneatus, Juniperus occidentalis</i>, and <i>Toxicodendron diversilobum</i>. Succession in the absence of fire tends to favor increased shrub dominance in the understory, increased tree density, and increased importance of conifers, with the end result being conversion to a conifer forest. This group merges into ~Californian Broadleaf Forest &amp; Woodland Group (G195)$$. This group occurs as both small patch and large patch in its dynamics. This west side version of this group is associated with dry, predominantly low-elevation sites and/or sites that experienced frequent presettlement fires. Elevations range from 600-1600 m (1800-4850 feet) on steep, rocky slopes where snow and cold temperatures occur. In the Willamette Valley, soils are mesic yet well-drained, and the stands are mostly large patch. In the Puget Lowland and Georgia Basin, this group is primarily found on dry sites, typically either shallow bedrock soils or deep gravelly glacial outwash soils. It occurs on various soils in the interior valleys of the Klamath Mountains, and on shallow soils of ""bald hill"" toward the coast. Even where more environmentally limited, the group is strongly associated with a historic low-severity fire regime. With frequent annual burning (at lower elevations and on warmer sites), this group is an open to dense woodland of large oaks with well-developed grassy understories of native perennial bunchgrass. Succession in the absence of fire tends to favor increased shrub dominance in the understory, increased tree density, and increased importance of conifers, with the end result being conversion to a conifer forest.

In some areas, <i>Picea glauca</i> also occurs, usually as dense stands on north-facing coulee slopes. <i>Populus tremuloides</i> tends to grow in pure stands as distinct copses in the southern part of the range, the size of the clumps becoming more extensive moving north. Some of the common shrubs include <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Corylus cornuta, Symphoricarpos albus, Symphoricarpos occidentalis, Prunus virginiana, Prunus pensylvanica, Ribes oxyacanthoides, Rosa acicularis, Rosa woodsii</i>, and <i>Salix bebbiana</i>. Common understory herbs include <i>Aralia nudicaulis, Actaea rubra, Cornus canadensis, Maianthemum canadense</i>, and <i>Maianthemum stellatum</i>. On poorly drained sites, <i>Populus tremuloides</i> may be associated with <i>Populus balsamifera</i>, with <i>Cornus sericea</i> and <i>Viburnum opulus</i> important components of the shrub layer. <i>Betula papyrifera</i> becomes more common on the north or on north-facing slopes. These woodland patches are commonly ringed by <i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i> on the drier side, moving into the adjacent prairie community, or by wetlands, with a ring of <i>Salix</i> spp., usually <i>Salix discolor</i>, then <i>Salix petiolaris</i> at the water's edge. <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> is found sporadically along the Qu'Appelle River valley and its tributaries in Saskatchewan, becoming more common into Manitoba. Common grasses and forbs include <i>Apocynum androsaemifolium, Aralia nudicaulis, Carex siccata, Carex sprengelii, Elymus trachycaulus, Lathyrus</i> spp., <i>Maianthemum stellatum, Maianthemum canadense, Oryzopsis asperifolia, Prosartes trachycarpa, Sanicula marilandica, Schizachne purpurascens, Thalictrum</i> spp., and <i>Vicia americana</i>. Fire and drought constitute the most important dynamics in this group. Much of this region has undulating to hummocky glacial till topography with depressional wetlands (potholes or kettles). Soils under the grasslands are generally Black Chernozems; Dark Grey Chernozems have developed under the woodlands and Gleysols are associated with the wetland patches.",,1.B.2.Ne.1.f

Higher elevation riparian plant associations are well documented by several authors (McCain and Diaz 2002b, Crowe et al. 2004, Kovalchik and Clausnitzer 2004, and others). However, probably due to the lack of areal extent and the difficulty in mapping them, these montane riparian habitats have not been described as a group per se. Flood ecosystems are ""infrequent at higher elevations where there are fewer topographic positions for floodplain development""(MacKenzie and Moran 2004). This group includes these streamside communities that may not have ""floodplains"" per se. Individual plant associations and sub-associations or site series have detailed floristics of units that are included in this group. More clarification is needed on the amount of woodland-dominated riparian areas at high altitudes in the Coast and Cascade ranges, for example the <i>Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata</i> types described from Prince Rupert Forest by Banner et al. (1993).

This group occurs for the most part on the west side of the Cascade crest, but also occurs around the Columbia Basin along the tributaries of the Columbia River. Surrounding habitats include subalpine parklands and montane forests. These woodlands are dependent on seasonally high water tables and frequent (once every 3-5 years) flooding to provide channel scour and deposition for germination and maintenance. They occur on streambanks and overflow channels, seeps and edges of waterbodies.

Third, the most common forest type in the northern part of the boreal forest (north of 51-52°N latitude) is <i>Picea mariana</i> / lichen woodland characterized by an open spruce cover (15-40% cover) and a lichen carpet (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) on the ground"" [these stands will be placed in a northern North American subarctic woodland group (under development)].<br /><br />At this time, this group excludes xeric <i>Pinus banksiana</i> and <i>Picea mariana</i> stands, which are placed in their own group, ~Ontario-Québec Boreal Dry-Mesic Black Spruce - Jack Pine Forest Group (G636)$$, which is found on dry, poor sites, where there is a low density of <i>Picea mariana</i> and <i>Pinus banksiana</i> trees, resulting in a woodland condition.

It occurs on dry nutrient-poor sandplains and along rocky ridges, often adjacent to rivers and lakes, and along talus slopes. The canopy ranges from patchy to continuous and is dominated by a mix of primarily conifer and hardwood species. In some examples, canopy trees may be stunted. <i>Picea mariana</i> and <i>Pinus banksiana</i> are the most frequent conifer species. Hardwood species vary in cover from 25-90% of the canopy. Most common are <i>Betula papyrifera</i> and <i>Populus</i> spp. In areas of open bedrock, species typical of bedrock outcrops and shallow soils can be found. The nonvascular layer can be absent or present with up to 30% cover. In the open bedrock areas, this layer consists mainly of the lichens and mosses. Infrequent fire is the primary dynamic, with catastrophic fires occurring approximately every 150-200 years with surface fires every 50-200 years.","The CNVC concept CG0005 appears to be the same as this IVC concept (G636), so the CNVC type has been provisionally replaced with the IVC type in the CNVC.",1.B.4.Na.1.h

[in preparation]","These floodplain forests are found in parts of the eastern boreal regions of Canada, extending to the extreme northern portions of the eastern U.S.","This is a moderately to richly minerotrophic forested peatland or floodplain type found across the eastern boreal regions of Canada, extending southward to the most northern Great Lakes region and most northern parts of the glaciated northeastern United States. Stands are typically found in glacial lakeplains, poorly drained basins, and kettleholes, with level, wet, poorly drained organic soils, and a shallow to thick layer of moderately decomposed peat. The pH typically exceeds 5.5. Trees form a partial to full cover over most or all of the peatland. Dominant trees include <i>Picea mariana, Abies balsamea, Larix laricina, Betula papyrifera</i>, and, less commonly, <i>Picea glauca</i> and <i>Thuja occidentalis</i>, either solely or in combination. On nutrient-rich flooded sites with primarily mineral soils and where water tables draw down during the growing season, broad-leaved deciduous trees often dominate. <i>Populus balsamifera, Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera</i>, and <i>Picea glauca</i> are common across all regions. In Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, <i>Acer negundo</i> may also be an important constituent. East of the Manitoba-Ontario border, <i>Fraxinus nigra, Thuja occidentalis</i>, and <i>Abies balsamea</i> are prevalent. Tall shrubs, especially <i>Alnus incana</i> and regenerating tree species, may form an open to dense, almost impenetrable layer. Other tall shrubs include <i>Acer spicatum, Cornus sericea, Sorbus americana, Sorbus decora, Salix</i> spp., <i>Ilex mucronata</i>, and <i>Viburnum nudum var. cassinoides</i> (in Quebec). Low shrubs and herbs are common in the understory. A sparse to moderately well-developed low-shrub layer contains ericaceous species such as <i>Ledum groenlandicum, Gaultheria hispidula, Vaccinium angustifolium</i>, and <i>Vaccinium myrtilloides</i>, but also includes minerotrophic species, such as <i>Lonicera canadensis</i> and <i>Ribes</i> spp., as well as <i>Linnaea borealis</i>.

These oak openings and barrens are often treated with prairie. For an example of this approach, see Minnesota DNR (2005) which treats southern dry savanna (oak barrens) and southern dry prairie together, and mesic savanna and mesic prairie together, and does the same for northern prairie and savanna types.

It was historically dominant in the northern glaciated regions of the Midwest with the largest concentration in the prairie-forest border ecoregion. It is typically found on rolling outwash plains, hills and ridges. Soils are typically moderately well- to well-drained deep loams. This savanna is typified by scattered trees, varying from 10 to 30% cover over a more-or-less continuous tallgrass prairie layer. <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> is a common tree throughout the range.

Where shrubs are present, <i>Corylus</i> spp. tend to be dominant, accompanied by species such as <i>Cornus foemina, Rosa</i> spp., <i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>, and <i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i> (in the west). Historically, frequent fires maintained this savanna within its range and would have restricted tree canopies to 10-30% cover. Fire suppression in the region has allowed trees to establish more dense canopies. Periodic, strong wind disturbances and browsing also impact this type. Much of this type has also been converted to agriculture, or succeeded to forests because of the lack of fire, greatly reducing its area and range.<br /><br />The sandy oak barrens occur on well-drained, coarse-textured sandy soils derived from glacial outwash, end moraine formations, or lakeplain dune systems in the north-central U.S. and parts of southern Ontario, Canada. Soils range from almost pure sand, to loamy sand, to sandy loam. The soils have low fertility, organic matter, and moisture-retention capacity. Factors which affect seasonal soil moisture are strongly related to variation in this type. The oak barrens is a scrubby, open-treed system dominated by graminoids and shrubs. Canopy structure varies from a dominant herbaceous ground layer with sparse, scattered ""savanna"" canopy (5-25%), through oak-dominated scrub, to a more closed woodland canopy (25-60%). The canopy layer is dominated by <i>Quercus velutina</i>, with some <i>Quercus ellipsoidalis, Quercus macrocarpa</i>, and <i>Quercus alba</i> (the latter more common eastward and in woodland conditions). Occasional <i>Pinus banksiana</i> can occur in the northern parts of the range.

Shrub species such as <i>Juniperus virginiana</i> can also increase in dominance with fire suppression. Conversion to agriculture likewise has decreased the range of this group.

They also occur to the east in the central Montana mountain ""islands"" foothills, as well as the Rocky Mountain Front and Big and Little Belt ranges. They also extend along the eastern slopes of the Alberta Rockies. The most important species are cool-season perennial bunchgrasses and forbs (&gt;25% cover), sometimes with a sparse (&lt;10% cover) shrub layer. <i>Festuca campestris</i> and <i>Festuca idahoensis</i> are dominants, and <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i> occurs as a codominant, as well as a diversity of other native grasses. To the north, <i>Danthonia parryi</i> becomes codominant. Forb diversity is typically high in both mesic and dry aspects of this group. A soil crust of lichen covers almost all open soil between clumps of grasses; <i>Cladonia</i> and <i>Peltigera</i> species are the most common lichens. Unvegetated mineral soil is commonly found between clumps of grass and the lichen cover. <i>Festuca campestris</i> is easily eliminated by grazing and does not occur in all areas of this group.<br /><br />This group also includes grasslands commonly known as ""Palouse Prairie."" These northern lower montane and valley grasslands represent a shift in the precipitation regime from summer monsoons and cold snowy winters found in the Southern Rockies to predominantly dry summers and winter precipitation. The Palouse region is characterized by rolling topography composed of loess hills and plains over basalt plains. The climate of this region has warm-hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Annual precipitation is high, 38-76 cm (15-30 inches). The soils are typically deep, well-developed, and old.<br /><br />Outside of the Palouse Prairie region, these grasslands are influenced by shorter summers, colder winters, and young soils derived from recent glacial and alluvial material. In the eastern portion of its range in Montana, winter precipitation is replaced by a huge spring peak in precipitation. Elevations range from 300 to 1650 m, ranging from small meadows to large open parks surrounded by conifers in the lower montane, to extensive foothill and valley grasslands below the lower treeline. Many of these valleys may have been primarily sage-steppe with patches of grassland in the past, but because of land-use history post-settlement (herbicide, grazing, fire suppression, pasturing, etc.), they have been converted to grassland-dominated areas. Soils are relatively deep, fine-textured, often with coarse fragments, and non-saline, often with a microphytic crust.<br /><br />In Alberta, this group occurs along the lower and eastern flanks of the Foothills Geologic Belt, primarily in the Foothills Fescue Grassland and Foothills Parkland Natural subregions. Glaciation and bedrock topography in combination result in a complex physiography from sloping lower foothills to hummocky to rolling uplands, mainly on glacial till, with significant lacustrine materials in valleys. Elevation ranges from 500 to 1525 m. At upper elevations, stands may be small-patch grasslands on southern slopes between <i>Populus tremuloides</i> woodlands or <i>Salix bebbiana</i> shrublands becoming quite extensive on moister sites at lower elevation.

It occurs along the coast on steep coastal terraces, headlands and bluffs, level ridgeline balds, and flat interior (leeward) meadows. The group includes many areas that are inland and do not have coastal exposure. Due to shallow soils, steep slopes, sunny aspect, and/or upper slope position, these sites are dry and marginal for tree establishment and growth except in favorable microsites. Fires, both lightning-ignited and those ignited by Native Americans, undoubtedly at least occasionally burn all these sites. Because of this fire history, the extent of this group has declined locally through tree invasion and growth, as areas formerly maintained as herbaceous by burning have filled in with trees. It occurs in the Coast Ranges, the Klamath Mountains and at low elevations on the lee side of the coastal mountains in the northern part of the range.",,2.B.2.Nf.5.a

Depositional areas, where Great Lakes beachgrass foredunes and coastal beaches are found, are dominated by <i>Ammophila breviligulata</i> (or in the eastern part of the range <i>Ammophila champlainensis</i>). Erosional areas, such as slacks in blowouts and dunefields, may be dominated by <i>Calamovilfa longifolia</i>, and stabilized areas by <i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>. Low evergreen shrubs (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Juniperus communis, Juniperus horizontalis</i>) occupy dune crests and also the ground layer in the savanna edge of dunes and sandplains. Deciduous shrubs are dominant in many areas and include <i>Prunus pumila, Salix cordata</i>, and <i>Salix myricoides</i>. <i>Populus deltoides</i> can form an open overstory canopy, while <i>Juniperus communis, Juniperus horizontalis, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>, and <i>Koeleria macrantha</i> form a scattered ground layer along low dunefields and sandplains with more advanced plant succession that often follows the first open dunes and swales.

Climates are cold enough to allow the rate of peat accumulation to exceed its decomposition. They contain a continuous (&gt;80% cover) layer of <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses (sometimes submerged in bog pools), to depths exceeding 40 cm, with ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and thin-leaved graminoids &gt;25% cover. Scrub trees &lt;2 m may be common, but trees &gt;5 m are &lt;10% cover. Acidic peatlands range from strictly ombrotrophic bog (isolated from groundwater, precipitation fed) to weakly minerotrophic poor fen. They occur in extensive areas of low flats, or develop in open or closed, relatively shallow basins with nutrient-poor and acidic conditions. Many occur in association with larger lakes or streams. Some occur as kettlehole fens (usually called kettlehole ""bogs"") associated with eskers or other glacial deposits. Poor fens often develop adjacent to open water and may form a floating mat over water. The surface morphology of a bog may be more-or-less level, domed, or eccentric, but typically is above the water table. As peat accumulates, ridges may form, which can be relatively dry compared to the flat areas. Secondary bog pools (schlenke) may be present in the raised portions of the peatlands. <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses play a key role in these systems because they trap base cations, causing the organic soils to acidify, and they retain moisture, thus slowing the decomposition rate and promoting peat accumulation. Species diversity is low. Dwarf-shrubs include <i>Chamaedaphne calyculata, Ledum groenlandicum, Kalmia polifolia, Andromeda polifolia, Vaccinium oxycoccos, Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>, occasionally <i>Gaultheria hispidula</i> or <i>Betula pumila</i>. Rarely, tall ericaceous shrubs such as <i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i> are dominant. Common sedges include <i>Carex oligosperma, Carex chordorrhiza, Carex magellanica </i>ssp<i>. irrigua, Carex limosa</i>, and <i>Carex lasiocarpa</i>. Other herbs include <i>Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum virginicum, Drosera rotundifolia, Menyanthes trifoliata, Sarracenia purpurea</i>, and <i>Scheuchzeria palustris</i>. When present, stunted <i>Picea mariana</i> and <i>Larix laricina</i> are the dominant trees. Dominant mosses include <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> and <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>, and less commonly <i>Sphagnum angustifolium. Pleurozium schreberi</i> can be common on raised mats.<br /><br />In the Atlantic region, from Labrador to Downeast Maine, acidic peatlands take on somewhat different characteristics. In basins, they develop raised plateaus with undulating sedge and dwarf-shrub vegetation. <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i> may form sedge lawns on the raised plateau. The system may also occur as ""blanket bogs"" over a sloping rocky substrate in extreme maritime settings; here, dwarf-shrubs and <i>Sphagnum</i> are the dominant cover. Species characteristic of this maritime setting include <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i>.

Due to drawdown characteristics, vernal pools typically form concentric rings of similar vegetation. Given their relative isolation in upland-dominated landscapes, many endemic plant species are found in vernal pools. Characteristic species are predominantly annual and diverse. Northern scabland vernal pools share about a third of the species found in northern California vernal pools, but they do not share many of the more common dominant species.

Hardpan vernal pools occur on soils with an indurated clay or cemented (Si or Fe) layer that retains water inputs throughout some portion of the spring, and that typically dry down completely into early summer months. In the Sand Juan and Gulf islands, they are created in small depressions in bedrock. Thus this group only occurs where there is hummocky micro-relief. These wetlands tend to be acidic wetlands. On the Columbia Plateau many pools are located on massive basalt flows, andesite or rhyodacite caprock. Inundation is highly irregular, sometimes not occurring for several years. Depressions usually (but not always) fill with water during winter and spring. They are generally dry again within nine months, though in exceptional times they can remain inundated for two years in a row. Water is from rainfall and snowmelt in relatively small closed basins, on average probably no more than 5-15 times the area of the ponds themselves. Pools are depressions with no outflows. Soils when present are typically silty clay, sometimes with sandy margins. Ponds range from very small (3 sqm) to large depressions (1600 sqm).",,2.C.4.Nb.3.b

Introduced forage species such as <i>Agrostis stolonifera, Poa pratensis, Phleum pratense</i>, and the invasive annual <i>Bromus tectorum</i> are often present in disturbed stands. Streams are permanent, intermittent and ephemeral. Stands occur in steep-sided canyons or in broad flat valleys. They can be large, wide occurrences on mid-channel islands in larger rivers or narrow bands on small, rocky canyon tributaries and well-drained benches. They also are typically found in backwater channels and other perennially wet but less scoured sites, such as floodplain swales and irrigation ditches, and they can occur in depressional wetlands and non-alkaline playas. Stands may also occur on upper benches away from active channel movement. Willow-dominated shrublands require flooding and bare gravels for reestablishment. Stands are maintained by annual flooding and hydric soils throughout the growing season. Sites are subject to temporary flooding during spring runoff. The water table is often just below the ground surface. Occurrences are found within the flood zone of rivers, on islands, sand or cobble bars, and immediate streambanks and upper benches, and occasionally on hillslope springs. This group occurs throughout the Rocky Mountain and Colorado Plateau regions from approximately 780 to 1850 m (2560-6000 feet) in elevation, around the edges and between the mountain ranges of the Great Basin and along the lower eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada at about 1220 m (4000 feet) in elevation, at lowland and montane elevations in the Columbia Plateau, on the periphery of the mountains surrounding the Columbia River Basin, and along major tributaries and the main stem of the Columbia at relatively low elevations. It also occurs in the foothills of the northern Rocky Mountains and the east slopes of the Cascades in the lower montane and foothill zones. Climate is generally semi-arid.",,2.C.4.Nb.5.a

Many are associated with hot and cold springs, located in basins with internal drainage. Soils are alkaline to saline clays with hardpans. Seasonal drying exposes mudflats colonized by annual wetland vegetation. Water is prevented from percolating through the soil by an impermeable soil subhorizon and is left to evaporate.

The vegetation is generally composed of low-growing perennial forbs and graminoids. On fell-field sites, total vegetation cover ranges from sparse to moderate cover dominated by cushion plants, whereas on turf sites, it ranges from open to moderately dense or dense cover dominated by graminoids or a mixture of graminoids and forbs (especially cushion plants). The graminoids are typically rhizomatous, sod-forming sedges such as <i>Carex elynoides, Carex helleri, Carex scirpoidea, Carex siccata, Carex nardina, Carex rupestris, Kobresia myosuroides</i>, and <i>Linanthus pungens</i>. Common fell-field species include <i>Arenaria capillaris, Erigeron pygmaeus, Eriogonum incanum, Geum rossii, Hulsea algida, Minuartia obtusiloba, Myosotis asiatica, Paronychia pulvinata, Phacelia hastata var. compacta, Phlox covillei, Phlox pulvinata, Saxifraga tolmiei, Silene acaulis, Trifolium dasyphyllum</i>, and <i>Trifolium parryi</i>. Many other graminoids, forbs, and prostrate shrubs can also be found, including <i>Calamagrostis purpurascens, Deschampsia cespitosa, Dryas octopetala, Ericameria discoidea, Festuca brachyphylla, Festuca idahoensis, Leucopoa kingii, Luzula spicata, Poa arctica, Poa glauca, Poa secunda</i> (Great Basin), <i>Podistera nevadensis, Polygonum bistortoides, Saxifraga</i> spp., <i>Selaginella densa</i>, and <i>Solidago</i> spp. Fell-fields are usually found within or adjacent to alpine dry turf with many of the same prostrate and mat-forming plants found in both, frequently with broad transition zones. Great Basin alpine areas tend to be drier with smaller turf patches and include some species common in desert scrub such as <i>Elymus elymoides</i> and <i>Poa secunda</i>. Vegetation in these areas is controlled by snow retention, wind desiccation, permafrost, and a short growing season. Fell-fields are typically free of snow during the winter as they are found on ridgetops, upper slopes and exposed saddles, whereas dry turf is found on gentle to moderate slopes, flat ridges, valleys, and basins where the soil has become relatively stabilized and the water supply is more-or-less constant. Fell-field substrates are generally shallow, stony, low in organic matter, and poorly developed with wind deflation often resulting in a gravelly pavement. Alpine turf sites have deeper, more developed soils, although there may be moderately high cover of cobbles and boulders present. Although alpine dry turf may form the matrix or large patches of the alpine zone, it typically intermingles with alpine bedrock and scree, ice field, fell-field, alpine dwarf-shrubland, and alpine/subalpine wet meadow systems.",,4.B.1.Nb.2.b

Sites include steep slopes, steep cliff faces, narrow canyons, and rock outcrops. Substrates include thin rocky, ultramafic (peridotite, serpentinite) soils in the Cascades, and unstable scree below cliff faces in the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Range. Parent materials are derived from various igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic bedrock. Vegetation is highly variable and typically sparse and scattered, varying from areas dominated by mosses and lichens to occasional closed forests in the Cascades. Species in the Cascades may include <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus ponderosa</i>, and <i>Pinus monticola</i> trees with a sparse ground cover with <i>Aspidotis densa, Arctostaphylos nevadensis</i>, and <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i> at low-elevation sites.

This group is found on the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands, Coast Mountains of British Columbia, as well as in the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon, south to just inside northern California. Characteristic trees include <i>Abies</i> spp., <i>Callitropsis nootkatensis, Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> (not in Alaska), <i>Thuja plicata</i>, or <i>Tsuga</i> spp. There may be scattered shrubs present, such as <i>Acer circinatum, Alnus viridis</i>, and <i>Ribes</i> spp. Soil development is limited as is herbaceous cover. Mosses or lichens may be very dense, well-developed and display cover well over 10%. Substrates include active volcanic areas dominated by ash, pyroclastic deposits, lava, landslides and other exposed bare mineral and rock of various igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic bedrock types. Periodic eruptions and earthquakes are the primary processes maintaining a primarily barren environment. Decades of inactivity slowly provide opportunity for vegetation development as primary successional stages. Elevation ranges from foothill to subalpine, and includes steep cliff faces, narrow canyons, larger rock outcrops, unstable scree and talus slopes. The dominant process is the extreme growing conditions created by exposed rock or unstable slopes, with drought becoming more of an issue in the southern part of the range. Alaskan montane rock and talus is not drought-limited.",,6.B.1.Nb.1.d
