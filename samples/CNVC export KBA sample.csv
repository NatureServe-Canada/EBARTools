It occurs in the northern Great Plains, in the boreal forest-prairie grassland transition region. The climate in this region is mostly subhumid low boreal with short, warm summers and cold, long winters. The physiognomy of the area is distinct woodland patches, in moist protected areas on slopes or depressions. Trees are generally short in stature, reaching mature heights of 15-20 m at the northern edge of the range, but averaging 5-10 m on well-drained sites at the southern limit of tree growth in the prairie grasslands. <i>Populus tremuloides</i> dominates this group. Common associates are <i>Populus balsamifera</i>, with an understory of tall shrubs and diverse herbs. In some areas, <i>Picea glauca</i> also occurs, usually as dense stands on north-facing coulee slopes. <i>Populus tremuloides</i> tends to grow in pure stands as distinct copses in the southern part of the range, the size of the clumps becoming more extensive moving north. Some of the common shrubs include <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Corylus cornuta, Symphoricarpos albus, Symphoricarpos occidentalis, Prunus virginiana, Prunus pensylvanica, Ribes oxyacanthoides, Rosa acicularis, Rosa woodsii</i>, and <i>Salix bebbiana</i>. Common understory herbs include <i>Aralia nudicaulis, Actaea rubra, Cornus canadensis, Maianthemum canadense</i>, and <i>Maianthemum stellatum</i>. On poorly drained sites, <i>Populus tremuloides</i> may be associated with <i>Populus balsamifera</i>, with <i>Cornus sericea</i> and <i>Viburnum opulus</i> important components of the shrub layer. <i>Betula papyrifera</i> becomes more common on the north or on north-facing slopes. These woodland patches are commonly ringed by <i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i> on the drier side, moving into the adjacent prairie community, or by wetlands, with a ring of <i>Salix</i> spp., usually <i>Salix discolor</i>, then <i>Salix petiolaris</i> at the water's edge. <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> is found sporadically along the Qu'Appelle River valley and its tributaries in Saskatchewan, becoming more common into Manitoba. Common grasses and forbs include <i>Apocynum androsaemifolium, Aralia nudicaulis, Carex siccata, Carex sprengelii, Elymus trachycaulus, Lathyrus</i> spp., <i>Maianthemum stellatum, Maianthemum canadense, Oryzopsis asperifolia, Prosartes trachycarpa, Sanicula marilandica, Schizachne purpurascens, Thalictrum</i> spp., and <i>Vicia americana</i>. Fire and drought constitute the most important dynamics in this group. Much of this region has undulating to hummocky glacial till topography with depressional wetlands (potholes or kettles). Soils under the grasslands are generally Black Chernozems; Dark Grey Chernozems have developed under the woodlands and Gleysols are associated with the wetland patches.","","1.B.2.1.2.f","","","","","",""

It also contains the distinctive Central Appalachian shale barrens of low to mid elevations. Most examples are dominated by <i>Pinus rigida</i> and/or <i>Pinus virginiana</i>. The canopy is usually patchy to open, but areas of closed canopy may be present. The shrub and vine layer may be well-developed, with <i>Quercus ilicifolia, Smilax rotundifolia and </i>other acid-tolerant species most characteristic. Herbs are usually sparse but graminoids include <i>Schizachyrium scoparium, Deschampsia flexuosa</i>, and <i>Danthona spicata.</i> Fire is a very important ecological process in this group. Frequent, low-intensity fires coupled with periodic severe fires is one factor that determines the occurrence of this vegetation rather than hardwood forests under natural conditions. The pines may be able to maintain dominance due to edaphic conditions, such as very shallow soil or extreme exposure in some areas, which can produce sustained drought conditions, but most sites appear eventually to succeed to oak dominance in the absence of fire. Fire can influence vegetation structure, producing a more open woodland canopy structure and more herbaceous ground cover. Stands typically occur at moderate to upper elevations (450-1200 m [1500-4000 feet]), but some examples may be found at lower elevations. The underlying rock is acidic and sedimentary or metasedimentary (e.g., quartzites, sandstones and shales). The soils are very infertile, shallow and droughty. A thick, poorly decomposed duff layer, along with dead wood and highly volatile ericaceous shrubs, creates a strongly fire-prone habitat.<br /><br />In floristically distinctive shale barrens examples, the exposed aspects, parent material with high levels of toxic metals, and lack of soil create extreme conditions for plant growth. Vegetation is mostly of a woodland physiognomy, but may include large open areas of sparse vegetation. The dominant trees are primarily <i>Quercus montana</i> and <i>Pinus virginiana</i>. Shale barrens endemics are diagnostic in the herb layer. The substrate includes areas of solid rock as well as unstable areas of shale scree, usually steeply sloped. The fully exposed areas are extremely dry. These barrens are high in endemic species.","","1.B.2.Na.01.f","","","","","",""

It was historically dominant in the northern glaciated regions of the Midwest with the largest concentration in the prairie-forest border ecoregion. It is typically found on rolling outwash plains, hills and ridges. Soils are typically moderately well- to well-drained deep loams. This savanna is typified by scattered trees, varying from 10 to 30% cover over a more-or-less continuous tallgrass prairie layer. <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> is a common tree throughout the range.

Where shrubs are present, <i>Corylus</i> spp. tend to be dominant, accompanied by species such as <i>Cornus foemina, Rosa</i> spp., <i>Rubus allegheniensis</i>, and <i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i> (in the west). Historically, frequent fires maintained this savanna within its range and would have restricted tree canopies to 10-30% cover. Fire suppression in the region has allowed trees to establish more dense canopies. Periodic, strong wind disturbances and browsing also impact this type. Much of this type has also been converted to agriculture, or succeeded to forests because of the lack of fire, greatly reducing its area and range.<br/><br/>The sandy oak barrens occur on well-drained, coarse-textured sandy soils derived from glacial outwash, end moraine formations, or lakeplain dune systems in the north-central U.S. and parts of southern Ontario, Canada. Soils range from almost pure sand, to loamy sand, to sandy loam. The soils have low fertility, organic matter, and moisture-retention capacity. Factors which affect seasonal soil moisture are strongly related to variation in this type. The oak barrens is a scrubby, open-treed system dominated by graminoids and shrubs. Canopy structure varies from a dominant herbaceous ground layer with sparse, scattered ""savanna"" canopy (5-25%), through oak-dominated scrub, to a more closed woodland canopy (25-60%). The canopy layer is dominated by <i>Quercus velutina</i>, with some <i>Quercus ellipsoidalis, Quercus macrocarpa</i>, and <i>Quercus alba</i> (the latter more common eastward and in woodland conditions). Occasional <i>Pinus banksiana</i> can occur in the northern parts of the range. Species found in the herb layer include <i>Ambrosia psilostachya, Amphicarpaea bracteata, Artemisia ludoviciana, Andropogon gerardii, Calamovilfa longifolia, Carex pensylvanica, Carex</i> spp., <i>Comandra umbellata, Sorghastrum nutans, Hesperostipa spartea</i>, and <i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>.

Stands of this alliance are found on well-drained, coarse-textured sandy soils derived from glacial outwash or end moraine formations. Soils range from almost pure sand, to loamy sand, to sandy loam. The soils have low fertility, organic matter, and moisture-retention capacity. Factors which affect seasonal soil moisture are strongly related to variation in this type; slope, aspect, topographic position, elevation, depth to water table, and presence or absence of less permeable soil layers are among these factors. The conditions were also favorable to periodic fires, necessary to maintain the open structure and floristic composition.","","1.B.2.Na.06.f.Quercus velutina - Quercus ellipsoidalis Wooded Grassland Alliance","G181","","Central & Northern Tallgrass Oak Openings & Barrens","Central & Northern Tallgrass Oak Openings & Barrens","",""

Chapters in Barbour and Billings (2000) treat the red spruce - fir within the eastern deciduous forest region rather than boreal, following the treatment of Braun (1950). Here we place all stands with <i>Picea rubens</i> with other cool-temperate types. We restrict the term ""boreal"" to North American forests within Bailey's (1997) subarctic ""Tayga (boreal forest)"" ecoregion, and will continue to review this issue with Canadian partners. Sites with a history of fire may support a canopy of early-successional hardwoods (<i>Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera</i>, and/ or <i>Populus</i> spp.), but even in these stands spruce and fir are typically dominant in the understory.

Stands dominated by <i>Larix occidentalis</i> grow best on mesic sites, but also may occur on relatively dry sites. Sites include valley bottoms, benches and lower mountain slopes often on the more mesic north and east aspects, but it is found on all aspects in its northern extent. Substrates are variable, but may include glacial till or colluvium derived from limestone, argillite and quartzite. Soils range from gravelly to non-gravelly loams and silt loams, occasionally with finer texture subsoils. Stands are dominated by the shade-intolerant, fire-tolerant, cold-deciduous conifer <i>Larix occidentalis</i>. They are typically even-aged, developing after catastrophic disturbances such as crownfires or clearcuts. Stand height varies from 30-55 m but can be much less if trees are stunted by high stocking densities of seedlings that may form ""doghair"" stands similar to <i>Pinus contorta</i>. Young stands may appear to be pure stands of <i>Larix occidentalis</i>, but with time develop into mixed-species stands as slower growing, shade-tolerant species become codominant, including <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> or <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>. Unless there are frequent fires to reduce the shade-tolerant subcanopy, <i>Larix occidentalis</i> may be over overtopped and quickly decline. Other than juvenile shade-tolerant trees, the understory may have shrub and herbaceous layers depending on tree canopy closure. Shrubs may include <i>Acer glabrum, Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata, Amelanchier alnifolia, Paxistima myrsinites, Physocarpus malvaceus, Rubus parviflorus, Salix scouleriana, Symphoricarpos albus</i>, and <i>Vaccinium</i> spp. The herbaceous layer is often conspicuous. Adjacent stands include other montane and subalpine forests dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies lasiocarpa, Picea engelmannii, Pinus contorta, Pinus ponderosa, Thuja plicata</i>, and <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i>. This alliance ranges from 500-1600 m in elevation. Stands in Montana are mostly above 1000 m. Climate is temperate, continental with influences from the Pacific maritime. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 71-81 cm, occurring mostly in the winter with about 20% of the annual precipitation falling in the growing season in May-June. July and August are typically dry. Snow is common in the middle to upper elevation and higher latitude sites. These stands are restricted by cold, short growing seasons and drought at lower elevations.","","1.B.2.Nb.2.a.Larix occidentalis Central Rocky Mountain Forest Alliance","G211","","Central Rocky Mountain-Interior Mesic Grand Fir - Douglas-fir - Western Larch Forest","Central Rocky Mountain-Interior Mesic Grand Fir - Douglas-fir - Western Larch Forest","",""

It also occurs east across Idaho into the eastern foothills of the Montana Rockies. This group includes two physiognomic phases: true woodlands of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> with shrubby or grassy understories, and ""wooded steppes"" with widely spaced, scattered <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> trees over generally shrubby but sparse understories. The former are generally fire-maintained, while the later are often too dry and with widely spaced vegetation to carry fire. <i>Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa</i> is the predominant conifer; <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> or <i>Pinus flexilis</i> may be present in the tree canopy but are usually absent. The understory can be shrubby, with <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Arctostaphylos patula, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Artemisia tridentata, Cercocarpus ledifolius, Physocarpus malvaceus, Purshia tridentata, Rosa</i> spp., <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>, or <i>Symphoricarpos oreophilus</i> as common species. In transition areas with sagebrush steppe, <i>Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata, Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis, Artemisia tripartita</i>, and <i>Purshia tridentata</i> may be common in fire-protected sites such as rocky areas. Deciduous shrubs, such as <i>Physocarpus malvaceus, Spiraea betulifolia</i>, or <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>, can be abundant in more northerly sites or more moist climates. Herbaceous vegetation in the true savanna occurrences is predominantly fire-resistant grasses and forbs that resprout following surface fires; shrubs, understory trees and downed logs are uncommon. These more open stands support grasses such as <i>Achnatherum</i> spp., dry <i>Carex</i> species (<i>Carex inops</i>), <i>Elymus elymoides, Festuca campestris, Festuca idahoensis, Hesperostipa</i> spp., or <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>. These woodlands and savannas occur at the lower treeline/ecotone between grasslands or shrublands and more mesic coniferous forests, typically on warm, dry, exposed sites. These interior Pacific Northwest woodlands receive winter and spring rains, and thus have a greater spring ""green-up"" than the drier woodlands in the Central Rockies. However, sites are often too droughty to support a closed tree canopy. Elevations range from less than 500 m in British Columbia to 1600 m in the central Idaho mountains. Occurrences are found on all slopes and aspects; however, moderately steep to very steep slopes or ridgetops and plateaus are most common. This group generally occurs on most geological substrates from weathered rock to glacial deposits to eolian deposits. Characteristic soil features include good aeration and drainage, coarse textures, circumneutral to slightly acidic pH, an abundance of mineral material, and periods of drought during the growing season. Some occurrences may occur as edaphic climax communities on very skeletal, infertile and/or excessively drained soils, such as pumice, cinder or lava fields, and scree slopes. Surface textures are highly variable in this group, ranging from sand to loam and silt loam. Exposed rock and bare soil consistently occur to some degree in all the associations. The more mesic portions of this group may include <i>Calamagrostis rubescens</i> or <i>Carex geyeri</i>, species more typical of ~Central Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir - Pine Forest Group (G210)$$. Mixed fire regimes and surface fires of variable return intervals maintain these woodlands, typically with a shrub-dominated or patchy shrub layer, depending on climate, degree of soil development, and understory density. Historically, many of these woodlands and savannas lacked the shrub component as a result of 3- to 7-year fire-return intervals.","","1.B.2.Nb.3.a","","","","","",""

Most occurrences of this group are dominated by a mix of <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> (but there can be one without the other) and other typically seral species, including <i>Larix occidentalis</i> (not in central Montana), <i>Pinus contorta</i>, and <i>Pinus monticola</i> (not in central Montana). <i>Picea engelmannii</i> (or <i>Picea glauca</i> or their hybrid) becomes increasingly common towards the eastern edge of the range. In the eastern Cascades, <i>Pinus contorta</i> may be the codominant pine, rather than <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>. The nature of this forest group is a matrix of large patches dominated or codominated by one or combinations of the above species; <i>Abies grandis</i> (a fire-sensitive, shade-tolerant species not occurring in central Montana) has increased on many sites once dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, which were formerly maintained by low-severity wildfire. Understories are typically dominated by graminoids, such as <i>Calamagrostis rubescens, Carex geyeri, Carex rossii</i>, and <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>, and a variety of shrubs, such as <i>Acer glabrum, Juniperus communis, Physocarpus malvaceus, Spiraea betulifolia, Symphoricarpos albus</i>, or <i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i> on mesic sites. <i>Abies concolor</i> and <i>Abies grandis x concolor</i> hybrids in central Idaho (the Salmon Mountains) may occur in some stands, but have very restricted ranges in this area. <i>Abies concolor</i> and <i>Abies grandis</i> in the Blue Mountains of Oregon are probably hybrids of the two and mostly <i>Abies grandis</i>. This group is associated with a submesic climate regime with annual precipitation ranging from 50 to 100 cm, with a maximum in winter or late spring. Winter snowpacks typically melt off in early spring at lower elevations. Elevations range from 460 to 1920 m. These communities rarely form either upper or lower timberline forests. Presettlement fire regimes may have been characterized by frequent, low-intensity surface fires that maintained relatively open stands of a mix of fire-resistant species. Under present conditions the fire regime is mixed-severity and more variable, with stand-replacing fires more common, and the forests are more homogeneous. With vigorous fire suppression, longer fire-return intervals are now prevalent, and multi-layered stands of <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus ponderosa</i>, and/or <i>Abies grandis</i> provide fuel ""ladders,"" making these forests more susceptible to high-intensity, stand-replacing fires. They are very productive forests which have been priority areas for timber production.","","1.B.2.Nb.3.b","","","","","",""

At upper elevation range, stands are limited to the most xeric aspects on rock outcrops, and at lower elevations to the less xeric north aspects on coarse substrates where water infiltration is greater (reverse texture effect).

The understory may also be dominated by mesic herbaceous species such as <i>Actaea rubra, Calamagrostis canadensis, Clintonia uniflora, Erigeron eximius, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Luzula glabrata var. hitchcockii, Maianthemum stellatum, Rubus pedatus, Saxifraga bronchialis, Thalictrum</i> spp., <i>Tiarella</i> spp., and <i>Valeriana sitchensis</i>. Disturbances include occasional blowdown, insect outbreaks (30-50 years), mixed-severity fire, and stand-replacing fire (every 150-500 years). The more summer-dry climatic areas also have occasional high-severity fires.","","1.B.2.Nb.5.c","","","","","",""

The climate is typically very cold and snowy in winter and relatively dry and cool in summer. The upper and lower elevational limits, due to climatic variability and differing topography, vary considerably; in interior British Columbia, this group occurs between 1400 and 2200 m elevation, and in northwestern Montana, it occurs up to 2400 m. Landforms include ridgetops, mountain slopes, glacial trough walls and moraines, talus slopes, landslides and rockslides, cirque headwalls and basins. Some sites have little snow accumulation because of high winds and sublimation. In this harsh, often windswept environment, trees are typically stunted and flagged from damage associated with wind, blowing snow and ice crystals, especially at the upper elevations of the type. The stands or patches often originate when <i>Pinus albicaulis</i>, and in some communities <i>Picea engelmannii</i>, colonize a sheltered site such as the lee side of a rock. <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> can then colonize in the shelter of either species. These high-elevation coniferous woodlands are dominated by <i>Pinus albicaulis</i> and <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>, or <i>Larix lyallii</i>. The undergrowth is usually somewhat depauperate, but some stands support a near sward of heath plants, such as <i>Phyllodoce empetriformis, Vaccinium myrtillus</i>, and <i>Vaccinium scoparium</i>, that may be present to codominant. The herbaceous layer is sparse under dense shrub canopies or may be dense where the shrub canopy is open or absent. Common species include <i>Ligusticum grayi</i>(?), <i>Arnica latifolia, Xerophyllum tenax, Carex rossii, Carex geyeri</i>, and <i>Luzula glabrata var. hitchcockii</i>.

Common shrubs throughout the range of <i>Larix lyallii</i>-dominated woodlands include <i>Phyllodoce empetriformis, Vaccinium deliciosum</i>, and <i>Vaccinium scoparium</i>. <i>Arnica latifolia</i> and <i>Luzula glabrata var. hitchcockii</i> are common, widespread herbaceous associates. Adjacent vegetation is often alpine tundra or permanent snowfields at the upper elevation margin and coniferous forest (usually <i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>-dominated in the Cascades, <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>-dominated in the northern Rockies) at the lower margin. At similar elevations, stands of <i>Pinus albicaulis</i> may occur on adjacent south-facing slopes or ridges with lower snow accumulations and seasonal soil drought. Stands usually occur above the upper limits of other trees on north-facing cirques or slopes where snowfields lie until June or July. Elevation ranges from 2000-2800 m, and frost may occur any time of the year. The climate is very snowy and moist with yearly snow accumulations of over 3 m in the northern Cascades and 2-3 m in the Rockies. Abrasion by wind-driven snow is characteristic and leads to stunted or flagged trees in most stands. Soils are poorly developed and almost exclusively of fractured granitic or quartzite rocks which have not been previously colonized by other vascular plants. The majority of sites where stands of this alliance occur are in areas which experienced heavy alpine glaciation less than 12,000 years ago.","","1.B.2.Nb.5.g.Larix lyallii Woodland Alliance","G223","","Central Rocky Mountain Whitebark Pine - Subalpine Larch Forest & Woodland","Central Rocky Mountain Whitebark Pine - Subalpine Larch Forest & Woodland","",""

There is overlap in the amount of tree cover and relative dominance of tree species among stands in the different alliances. In British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, Achuff (1989) has also described a <i>Picea engelmannii - Abies lasiocarpa - Pinus albicaulis - Pinus contorta</i> forest and a couple of other <i>Pinus albicaulis</i> types that are related and need to be reviewed. However, woodland stands are generally more common on sites where high-elevation, rocky substrate or xeric habitats limit the tree cover, or occur on less xeric sites that are early-successional, where an understory of <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> has not developed into a tree canopy. Forest stands typically occur at lower elevations below the forestline and need disturbance to establish and maintain them or they will succeed to more shade-tolerant subalpine tree species after 100-120 years. The mixed <i>Abies lasiocarpa - Pinus albicaulis</i> woodland stands typically are mid-seral and occur on less xeric sites with shade-tolerant trees. As the exotic pathogen white pine blister rust or epidemics of mountain pine beetles reduce or eliminate <i>Pinus albicaulis</i> from these stands, species composition and cover will be affected dramatically.","","Alliance","1.B.2.Nb.5.g","1.B.2.Nb.5.g","C01","Forest & Woodland","S15","Temperate & Boreal Forest & Woodland","F008","Cool Temperate Forest & Woodland","1.B.2.Nb","D194","Rocky Mountain Forest & Woodland","M020","","Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Upper Montane Forest & Woodland","Rocky Mountain Subalpine - High Montane Forest","Rocky Mountain Subalpine - High Montane Forest","Forts subalpines et des montagnes de haute altitude des Rocheuses","","GNR","GNR","","NNR","NNR","","CA,US","AB, BC","ID, MT, NV, OR, WA, WY","","","Johnston, B.

In drier settings, <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> is usually also common. <i>Abies procera</i> forests (usually mixed with silver fir) are included in this group, as well as stands where <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> can occur as a codominant on the east side of the Cascades. Dry-setting understory species may include <i>Achlys triphylla, Mahonia nervosa, Xerophyllum tenax, Vaccinium membranaceum</i>, and/or <i>Rhododendron macrophyllum</i>. This group occurs at mid-montane elevations in dry to moist maritime, some hypermaritime and some submaritime climatic zones from northwestern Oregon, coastal British Columbia to extreme southeastern Alaska. It generally occurs in an elevational band above <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii - Tsuga heterophylla</i> and hypermaritime zone forests and below <i>Tsuga mertensiana</i> forests. It is known to occur on windward and leeward sides of Vancouver Island and on the Olympic Peninsula. In the Cascade Range of northern Washington (north of Snoqualmie River) and in the Coast Mountains of mainland British Columbia, it occurs in the wettest portions, including inland to the mountain crest. A somewhat variable winter snowpack that typically lasts for 2-4 months is characteristic. The climatic zone within which it occurs is sometimes referred to as the ""rain-on-snow"" zone because of the common occurrence of major winter rainfall on an established snowpack.","The CNVC concept CG0241 appears to be the same as this IVC concept (G241), so the CNVC type has been provisionally replaced with the IVC type in the CNVC.","1.B.2.Nd.1.d","","","","","",""

[in preparation]","These are tall evergreen conifer forests composed of <i>Tsuga heterophylla, Picea sitchensis</i>, and <i>Thuja plicata</i> (either mixed or singly) that occupy the hypermaritime zone of the Pacific Northwest rainforest region on and near the Pacific Coast, along a heavy rain and fog belt from about Prince Rupert, British Columbia, south to Point Arena, California.","These rainforests are dominated by tall evergreen needle-leaved trees, and are restricted to the outer coastal hypermaritime areas of southeastern Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and northern California. The forests are often open and scrubby but can have a closed upper canopy. Stands may be pure <i>Picea sitchensis, Thuja plicata</i>, or <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i> but are more often a mix and may occur with other conifers such as <i>Callitropsis nootkatensis, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Abies grandis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Acer circinatum, Alnus rubra, Acer macrophyllum</i>, and <i>Frangula purshiana</i>. <i>Abies amabilis</i> is widespread (except in southern Washington) and can be common but is not dominant. In Washington, nearly pure stands of <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i> are common and seem to be associated with microsites where exposure to intense windstorms is likely. Wet coastal environments that support stands of <i>Chamaecyparis lawsoniana</i> in the absence of <i>Tsuga heterophylla, Thuja plicata</i>, or <i>Picea sitchensis</i> are also part of this group. The understory is rich with shade-tolerant shrubs and ferns, including <i>Gaultheria shallon, Vaccinium ovatum, Menziesia ferruginea, Polystichum munitum, Dryopteris</i> spp., and <i>Blechnum spicant</i>, as well as a high diversity of mosses. <i>Oxalis oregana</i> is important in the understory of moist sites in Washington. <i>Oplopanax horridus</i> and <i>Rubus spectabilis</i> are important understory shrubs on wet sites dominated by <i>Picea sitchensis</i> in the overstory canopy, these sites tend to be sub-irrigated and wet, but not saturated, soils remain well-oxygenated.<br /><br />Stands are restricted to areas within 25 km of saltwater and are most abundant along coastal central British Columbia, coastal Vancouver Island, and on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. They range from southern southeastern Alaska (approximately south of Wrangell), through British Columbia, along the southern Washington, Oregon and northern California coasts. The climate is hypermaritime, with cool summers, mild and very wet winters (coldest temperatures range 0-5C [32-41F), and abundant fog without a major snowpack. Annual precipitation ranges from 975 to 2399 mm (38-94 inches) with an average of 1572 mm (62 inches) with the majority falling as winter rain. Summer rains are less frequent (&lt;10% of annual rainfall occurs in summer) which can be ameliorated by frequent, dense coastal fog and cloud cover.<br /><br />Stands are found mostly below 300 m in elevation, where the terrain is mostly gentle, of low topographic relief, and often rocky. Some stands occur on stabilized dunes, others in lower toeslopes and wet sites that are also well-drained, such as sloped floodplains (but are not influenced by overbank flooding) and coarse valley bottoms. Sites occupied include the outermost coastal fringe where salt spray is prominent, riparian terraces and valley bottoms near the coast where there is major fog accumulation. Soils typically have a distinct humus layer overlying mineral horizons or bedrock. In central British Columbia the humus layers can be very thick (mean = 17-35 cm). Soils are often imperfectly drained. These forests very rarely burn, and natural disturbance is more often single tree gap-disturbance events and intense winter storms on local and regional scales. Fire becomes more of a player in the southern portions of the range, in Oregon and California.","The CNVC concept CG0751 appears to be the same as this IVC concept (G751), so the CNVC type has been provisionally replaced with the IVC type in the CNVC.","1.B.2.Nd.1.f","","","","","",""

These forests are dominated by <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i> or <i>Picea sitchensis</i> but are also often mixed stands with other conifers often present to codominant, such as <i>Callitropsis nootkatensis</i> and <i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>. Stands of <i>Picea sitchensis</i> are often codominant with <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i>. At the southern end of the range, <i>Thuja plicata</i> may also occur, as well as <i>Pinus contorta</i>. The understory is rich with shade-tolerant shrubs and ferns, including <i>Gaultheria shallon, Vaccinium ovatum, Polystichum munitum, Dryopteris</i> spp., and <i>Blechnum spicant</i>, as well as a high diversity of mosses. Stands are mostly restricted to areas within 25 km of saltwater. They occur within the hypermaritime coastal boreal climatic zones of high precipitation in winter and summer along the coast. The northern limit is the northern extent of <i>Picea sitchensis</i>, where the dominant tree shifts to <i>Picea glauca</i> and climate becomes colder, with a true boreal climate at the coast. The southern limit is based on a transition to a more temperate climate, where minimum temperatures remain above 0C and summer precipitation begins to decrease, and additional species appear such as <i>Thuja plicata</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>. These forests occupy the outermost coastal fringe where salt spray is prominent, riparian terraces and valley bottoms near the coast where there is major fog accumulation and the maritime ""interior"" part of northern forests, often on steep, well-drained productive slopes. Annual precipitation ranges from 623 to 3235 mm (24-127 inches) with an average of 1464 mm (58 inches), that falls year-round, with the majority falling as rain on the immediate coast, but at higher elevations the climate is wet with heavy snow and rainfall, and coastal winter rains can be heavy. Coldest monthly temperature range from -15 to -1C (5-30F). Stands ranges from sea level to about 1000 m (3000 feet) in elevation. These forests occur along a coastal belt on deep, acidic soils derived from marine sediments, but can also occur at higher elevations along stream channels, snow avalanche paths, mass-wasting slopes or loess deposits. In British Columbia, much of the hypermaritime band is shallow soils derived from acidic bedrock with deep organic accumulations due to hypermaritime climate. Glaciation resulted in a scouring of the landscape with little till accumulation. There are also pockets of richer bedrock that is reflected in the productivity of the stands. Disturbance is mostly small-scale windthrow or other gap-mortality processes with occasional widespread intense windstorms.","The CNVC concept CG0750 appears to be the same as this IVC concept (G750), so the CNVC type has been provisionally replaced with the IVC type in the CNVC.","1.B.2.Nd.1.h","","","","","",""

It also appears in the adjacent Columbia Plateau ecoregion. Most occurrences of this group are dominated by a mix of <i>Quercus garryana</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>. Isolated, taller <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> over <i>Quercus garryana</i> trees characterize parts of this group. Clonal <i>Quercus garryana</i> can create dense patches across a grassy landscape or can dominate open woodlands or even savannas. The understory may include dense stands of shrubs or, more often, be dominated by grasses, sedges or forbs. Shrub-steppe shrubs may be prominent in some stands and create a distinct tree / shrub / sparse grassland habitat, including <i>Artemisia nova</i> (in Oregon only), <i>Artemisia tridentata, Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus</i>, and <i>Purshia tridentata</i>. Mesic sites have an open to closed sodgrass understory dominated by <i>Calamagrostis rubescens, Carex geyeri, Carex inops, Carex rossii</i>, or <i>Elymus glaucus</i>. Drier savanna and woodland understories typically contain bunchgrass steppe species such as <i>Festuca idahoensis</i> or <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>. Common exotic grasses that often appear in high abundance are <i>Bromus tectorum</i> and <i>Poa bulbosa</i>. Disjunct occurrences in the Klamath Mountains and southernmost Cascades typically have high cover of sagebrush and bitterbrush in the understory, along with other shrubs. In the Columbia River Gorge, this group appears as small to large patches in transitional areas in the Little White Salmon and White Salmon river drainages in Washington and Hood River, Rock Creek, Moiser Creek, Mill Creek, Threemile Creek, Fifteen Mile Creek, and White River drainages in Oregon. <i>Quercus garryana</i> can create dense patches often associated with grassland or shrubland balds within a closed <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forest landscape. Commonly the understory is shrubby and composed of <i>Ceanothus integerrimus, Holodiscus discolor, Symphoricarpos albus</i>, and <i>Toxicodendron diversilobum</i>. These woodlands occur at the lower treeline/ecotone between <i>Artemisia</i> spp. or <i>Purshia tridentata</i> steppe or shrubland and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> and/or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forest or woodland. Elevations range from 460 to 1920 m. Sites are typically warm with southern exposures with seasonal soil drought or desiccating winds. Substrates usually have bedrock, sand, or pumice soils which are excessively well-drained. Fire plays an important role in creating vegetation structure and composition in this habitat. Decades of fire suppression have led to invasion by <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> along lower treeline and by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> in the gorge and other oak patches on xeric sites in the east Cascade foothills. In the past, most of the habitat experienced frequent low-severity fires that maintained woodland or savanna conditions. The mean fire-return interval is 20 years, although variable. Soil drought plays a role, maintaining an open tree canopy in part of this dry woodland habitat.<br /><br />Westside: This group also occurs of the west side of the mountain ranges from the Cascades to the North Coast Ranges in California. It is limited to the southern portions of the North Pacific region where it occurs in southwestern British Columbia, in the Puget Trough and Willamette Valley south into the Klamath Mountains and into northern California, southward through the lower southern Cascades and western Modoc Plateau and the middle and inner North Coast Ranges into Mendocino County. The vegetation ranges from savanna and woodland to forest dominated by deciduous broadleaf trees, mostly <i>Quercus garryana</i>. Codominance by the evergreen conifer <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> is common, and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> is important in some stands. In the south, common associates also include <i>Quercus kelloggii</i> and <i>Arbutus menziesii</i>. The predominant oaks with the higher frequency fires include <i>Quercus kelloggii</i> and <i>Quercus garryana</i>, with <i>Quercus garryana var. garryana</i> codominant in the central and northern Coast Ranges, Klamath Mountains and Modoc Plateau. However, <i>Quercus garryana var. fruticosa</i> often codominates in the northwestern Coast Ranges. More isolated patches of shrubby, clonal <i>Quercus garryana var. semota</i> (similar to but apparently distinct from <i>var. fruticosa</i>) occur farther south into the Sierra Nevada southward to the Paiute and Tehachapi mountains (southern branches of the Sierra Nevada), but these are without <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and appear to behave more as montane chaparral stands. The perennial bunchgrass component includes <i>Danthonia californica</i> (close to the coast), <i>Elymus glaucus, Festuca californica</i>, and <i>Festuca idahoensis</i>. A variety of native forbs also occur. Other characteristic species include <i>Ceanothus cuneatus, Juniperus occidentalis</i>, and <i>Toxicodendron diversilobum</i>. Succession in the absence of fire tends to favor increased shrub dominance in the understory, increased tree density, and increased importance of conifers, with the end result being conversion to a conifer forest. This group merges into ~Californian Broadleaf Forest &amp; Woodland Group (G195)$$. This group occurs as both small patch and large patch in its dynamics. This west side version of this group is associated with dry, predominantly low-elevation sites and/or sites that experienced frequent presettlement fires. Elevations range from 600-1600 m (1800-4850 feet) on steep, rocky slopes where snow and cold temperatures occur. In the Willamette Valley, soils are mesic yet well-drained, and the stands are mostly large patch. In the Puget Lowland and Georgia Basin, this group is primarily found on dry sites, typically either shallow bedrock soils or deep gravelly glacial outwash soils. It occurs on various soils in the interior valleys of the Klamath Mountains, and on shallow soils of ""bald hill"" toward the coast. Even where more environmentally limited, the group is strongly associated with a historic low-severity fire regime. With frequent annual burning (at lower elevations and on warmer sites), this group is an open to dense woodland of large oaks with well-developed grassy understories of native perennial bunchgrass. Succession in the absence of fire tends to favor increased shrub dominance in the understory, increased tree density, and increased importance of conifers, with the end result being conversion to a conifer forest. This group merges into ~Californian Broadleaf Forest &amp; Woodland Group (G195)$$. This group occurs as both small patch and large patch in its dynamics.","","1.B.2.Nd.3.b","","","","","",""

Drier examples of flatwoods across the range of this group may have <i>Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Nyssa sylvatica, Quercus alba, Quercus rubra</i>, and <i>Quercus velutina</i>. Understory shrub and herbaceous species vary with moisture level and canopy density. Flooding, drought, and fire can impact examples of this vegetation.

This riparian group includes seasonally flooded forests found at montane to subalpine elevations of the Rocky Mountain cordillera, from southern New Mexico north into Montana, and west into the Intermountain West region and the Colorado Plateau. It occurs throughout the interior of British Columbia and the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range. These are communities tolerant of periodic flooding and high water tables. Snowmelt moisture may create shallow water tables or seeps for a portion of the growing season. Stands typically occur at elevations between 1500 and 3300 m (4920-10,830 feet); farther north, elevation ranges between 900 and 2000 m. This is confined to specific riparian environments occurring on floodplains or terraces of rivers and streams, in V-shaped, narrow valleys and canyons (where there is cold-air drainage). Less frequently, occurrences are found in moderately wide valley bottoms on large floodplains along broad, meandering rivers, and on pond or lake margins.","","1.B.3.Nc.1.a","","","","","",""

Stands generally occupy sites on benches, toeslopes or valley bottoms along mountain streams. Stands are usually dominated by conifers, but can have hardwoods mixed or dominant. These wetland types are generally distinguishable from other upland forests and woodlands by shallow water tables.","","1.B.3.Nc.1.b","","","","","",""

Higher elevation riparian plant associations are well documented by several authors (McCain and Diaz 2002b, Crowe et al. 2004, Kovalchik and Clausnitzer 2004, and others). However, probably due to the lack of areal extent and the difficulty in mapping them, these montane riparian habitats have not been described as a group per se. Flood ecosystems are ""infrequent at higher elevations where there are fewer topographic positions for floodplain development""(MacKenzie and Moran 2004). This group includes these streamside communities that may not have ""floodplains"" per se. Individual plant associations and sub-associations or site series have detailed floristics of units that are included in this group. More clarification is needed on the amount of woodland-dominated riparian areas at high altitudes in the Coast and Cascade ranges, for example the <i>Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata</i> types described from Prince Rupert Forest by Banner et al. (1993).

This group occurs for the most part on the west side of the Cascade crest, but also occurs around the Columbia Basin along the tributaries of the Columbia River. Surrounding habitats include subalpine parklands and montane forests. These woodlands are dependent on seasonally high water tables and frequent (once every 3-5 years) flooding to provide channel scour and deposition for germination and maintenance. They occur on streambanks and overflow channels, seeps and edges of waterbodies. They are distinguished from the surrounding forest by riparian/ wetland indicators, when dominated by deciduous tree species, are visually a sharp contrast to immediate upland conifer forests.","","1.B.3.Ng.1.e","","","","","",""

The canopy can be codominated by coniferous trees such as <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla</i>, and/or <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>. <i>Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa</i> is always present and is always mixed with equal to at least half as much conifer cover in the upper canopy. This alliance is found in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska at low elevations along major rivers on middle and high terraces. Stands occur on active floodplains on well-drained alluvial soils that either experience overbank flooding or high water tables during snowmelt and rainy seasons. Stands may also occur on higher terraces that are less likely to flood. Channels may be large like the Columbia and Willamette rivers, or occur along smaller tributaries. Stands may be far from an active channel, but are well within the active 100-year floodplain. This alliance does not include isolated hillside springs or seeps.","","1.B.3.Ng.1.f.Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa - Picea sitchensis - Tsuga heterophylla Riparian Forest Alliance","G852","","Alaskan Pacific Riparian Forest & Woodland","Alaskan Pacific Riparian Forest & Woodland","",""

Other distinctive aspects of their flora are under review by the Canadian NVC Technical Committee (K. Baldwin pers. comm. 2012). These forests have recently been referred to as ""boreal rainforests"" and, more technically, as ""perhumid boreal forests"" (Clayden et al. 2011). The authors provide an extended summary of the climatic characteristics of these forests. They also discuss the potential for recognition of ""perhumid hemi-boreal forests"" of eastern Canada, including the red spruce-northern hardwoods, and even eastern hemlock types, but they note that these perhumid stands occur in an eastern humid climate, and it is not clear whether they warrant a distinctly ""perhumid sector.""

Third, the most common forest type in the northern part of the boreal forest (north of 51-52N latitude) is <i>Picea mariana</i> / lichen woodland characterized by an open spruce cover (15-40% cover) and a lichen carpet (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) on the ground"" [these stands will be placed in a northern North American subarctic woodland group (under development)].<br /><br />At this time, this group excludes xeric <i>Pinus banksiana</i> and <i>Picea mariana</i> stands, which are placed in their own group, ~Ontario-Qubec Boreal Dry-Mesic Black Spruce - Jack Pine Forest Group (G636)$$, which is found on dry, poor sites, where there is a low density of <i>Picea mariana</i> and <i>Pinus banksiana</i> trees, resulting in a woodland condition.

It occurs on dry nutrient-poor sandplains and along rocky ridges, often adjacent to rivers and lakes, and along talus slopes. The canopy ranges from patchy to continuous and is dominated by a mix of primarily conifer and hardwood species. In some examples, canopy trees may be stunted. <i>Picea mariana</i> and <i>Pinus banksiana</i> are the most frequent conifer species. Hardwood species vary in cover from 25-90% of the canopy. Most common are <i>Betula papyrifera</i> and <i>Populus</i> spp. In areas of open bedrock, species typical of bedrock outcrops and shallow soils can be found. The nonvascular layer can be absent or present with up to 30% cover. In the open bedrock areas, this layer consists mainly of the lichens and mosses. Infrequent fire is the primary dynamic, with catastrophic fires occurring approximately every 150-200 years with surface fires every 50-200 years.","The CNVC concept CG0005 appears to be the same as this IVC concept (G636), so the CNVC type has been provisionally replaced with the IVC type in the CNVC.","1.B.4.Na.1.h","","","","","",""

The concept of this group includes boreal conifer swamps that may occur in limited parts of the Laurentian-Acadian region, especially in Minnesota and Maine. Although this is a rich swamp and floodplain type, its boreal characteristics appear to make it more acidic than ~Laurentian-Acadian Alkaline Swamp (G046)$$, and thus somewhat similar to ~Acadian-Appalachian Red Spruce Acidic Swamp (G045)$$. It is not clear whether northern examples of <i>Thuja occidentalis</i> swamps belong here (especially ~<i>Thuja occidentalis - (Picea mariana, Abies balsamea) / Alnus incana</i> Swamp Forest (CEGL002456)$$), but for now they are placed in ~Laurentian-Acadian Alkaline Swamp Group (G046)$$. That type is found in the central and southern parts of the Laurentian-Acadian region and may overlap this group, including in northern and central Minnesota, central and southern Ontario, and southern Quebec. That group more often contains northern hardwood and conifer species, such as <i>Acer rubrum, Betula alleghaniensis, Fraxinus nigra</i>, and <i>Tsuga canadensis</i>, along with diagnostic shrubs, such as <i>Ilex verticillata, Vaccinium corymbosum</i>, and <i>Aronia melanocarpa. Thuja occidentalis</i> and, more rarely, <i>Larix laricina</i> may also be found, along with <i>Picea rubens</i>. ~Ontario-Qubec Boreal Black Spruce Poor Swamp Group (G806)$$ overlaps in concept with this type, but lacks the minerotrophic indicators and often has a very continuous layer of sphagnum.","","Group","1.B.5.Na.2.b","1.B.5.Na.2.b","C01","Forest & Woodland","S15","Temperate & Boreal Forest & Woodland","F036","Boreal Flooded & Swamp Forest","1.B.5.Na","D016","North American Boreal Flooded & Swamp Forest","M300","","North American Boreal Flooded & Rich Swamp Forest","North American Boreal Flooded & Rich Swamp Forest","","Marcages riches et inonds de l'Amrique du Nord","","G4G5","G4","2022-01-26","NNR","NNR","","CA,US","LB, MB, NB, NS, ON, PE?, QC","ME, MI, MN, NH, NY, VT, WI","","","Faber-Langendoen, D., J.

[in preparation]","These floodplain forests are found in parts of the eastern boreal regions of Canada, extending to the extreme northern portions of the eastern U.S.","This is a moderately to richly minerotrophic forested peatland or floodplain type found across the eastern boreal regions of Canada, extending southward to the most northern Great Lakes region and most northern parts of the glaciated northeastern United States. Stands are typically found in glacial lakeplains, poorly drained basins, and kettleholes, with level, wet, poorly drained organic soils, and a shallow to thick layer of moderately decomposed peat. The pH typically exceeds 5.5. Trees form a partial to full cover over most or all of the peatland. Dominant trees include <i>Picea mariana, Abies balsamea, Larix laricina, Betula papyrifera</i>, and, less commonly, <i>Picea glauca</i> and <i>Thuja occidentalis</i>, either solely or in combination. On nutrient-rich flooded sites with primarily mineral soils and where water tables draw down during the growing season, broad-leaved deciduous trees often dominate. <i>Populus balsamifera, Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera</i>, and <i>Picea glauca</i> are common across all regions. In Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, <i>Acer negundo</i> may also be an important constituent. East of the Manitoba-Ontario border, <i>Fraxinus nigra, Thuja occidentalis</i>, and <i>Abies balsamea</i> are prevalent. Tall shrubs, especially <i>Alnus incana</i> and regenerating tree species, may form an open to dense, almost impenetrable layer. Other tall shrubs include <i>Acer spicatum, Cornus sericea, Sorbus americana, Sorbus decora, Salix</i> spp., <i>Ilex mucronata</i>, and <i>Viburnum nudum var. cassinoides</i> (in Quebec). Low shrubs and herbs are common in the understory. A sparse to moderately well-developed low-shrub layer contains ericaceous species such as <i>Ledum groenlandicum, Gaultheria hispidula, Vaccinium angustifolium</i>, and <i>Vaccinium myrtilloides</i>, but also includes minerotrophic species, such as <i>Lonicera canadensis</i> and <i>Ribes</i> spp., as well as <i>Linnaea borealis</i>. The diverse herb layer includes the sedges <i>Carex disperma, Carex leptalea, Carex trisperma</i>, and the forbs <i>Clintonia borealis, Coptis trifolia, Cornus canadensis, Equisetum</i> spp., <i>Lycopodium annotinum, Maianthemum canadense, Maianthemum trifolium, Oxalis montana, Rubus pubescens</i>, and <i>Trientalis borealis</i>. Fern species, including <i>Osmunda cinnamomea, Osmunda claytoniana, Gymnocarpium dryopteris</i>, and <i>Dryopteris</i> spp., can be abundant in richer stands. Mosses range from partial mats of sphagnum (especially <i>Sphagnum fuscum, Sphagnum girgensohnii, Sphagnum magellanicum</i>) and feathermosses (<i>Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi</i>, and <i>Ptilium crista-castrensis</i>), especially on hummocks, to brown moss species, especially in hollows.","The CNVC concept CG0021 appears to be the same as this IVC concept (G809), so the CNVC type has been provisionally replaced with the IVC type in the CNVC.","1.B.5.Na.2.b","","","","","",""

Other common species include <i>Hesperostipa curtiseta</i>. Common woody species include <i>Artemisia cana, Symphoricarpos occidentalis, Rhus trilobata</i>, and <i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i>. Some examples may range into more of a shrub-steppe. Common forbs include <i>Opuntia polyacantha, Sphaeralcea coccinea</i>, and <i>Artemisia frigida</i>. Fire, drought, and grazing constitute the primary dynamics affecting this group. Its presence is generally correlated with arid areas that have mean precipitation of 350 mm per year or less. Stands occur on a wide variety of landforms, with flat to rolling topography and some low-relief hummocky areas. Surficial materials are predominantly glacial till in the Canadian areas, with some glacio-lacustrine areas. Glacio-fluvial sediments are common along major river valleys, and eolian materials are prevalent in some areas. Predominant soils are deep and well-drained to imperfectly drained, have a thick, dark A horizon and are classed as Brown Chernozems in the Canadian system. Textures are sandy loam to loam, medium- to coarser-textured soils.

The vegetation is dominated by moderate to moderately dense medium-tall grasses or sometimes, in the western Great Plains and Sandhills region of northwest Nebraska, a mix of tall and medium-tall grasses. Shrubs are usually scattered or absent but can form dense, local patches, particularly in swales or low areas. Dominant species include <i>Pascopyrum smithii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Carex inops ssp. heliophila</i>, and <i>Carex filifolia</i>. In Montana, this includes <i>Festuca idahoensis</i>. Sites with a strong component of <i>Nassella viridula</i> indicate a more favorable moisture balance and perhaps a favorable grazing regime as well because this is one of the most palatable of the midgrasses. <i>Calamovilfa longifolia</i> is often found with high cover values on sandier soils, and <i>Koeleria macrantha</i> cover increases on degraded sites. Common or dominant tallgrasses in the western Great Plains are <i>Andropogon gerardii, Panicum virgatum</i>, and <i>Sorghastrum nutans</i>. Other common species include <i>Bouteloua curtipendula, Bouteloua gracilis, Hesperostipa curtiseta, Hesperostipa neomexicana, Muhlenbergia montana, Pseudoroegneria spicata, Sorghastrum nutans</i>, and <i>Sporobolus cryptandrus</i>. Common woody species include <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Artemisia cana, Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda, Juniperus horizontalis, Prunus virginiana, Rhus trilobata</i>, and <i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>. Some examples may range into more of a shrub-steppe. Fire and grazing constitute the primary dynamics affecting this group. Drought can also impact it, in general favoring the shortgrass component at the expense of the midgrasses. With intensive grazing, cool-season exotics such as <i>Poa pratensis, Bromus inermis</i>, and <i>Bromus arvensis</i> can increase in dominance. Shrub species such as <i>Juniperus virginiana</i> can also increase in dominance with fire suppression. Conversion to agriculture likewise has decreased the range of this group. This group occurs on a wide variety of landforms (e.g., mesatops, stream terraces) and in proximity to a diversity of other groups. Soils range from fine-textured loams to sandy or gravelly soils.","","2.B.2.Nb.3.c","","","","","",""

For now, in a North American context, it is treated as a group, because apart from <i>Festuca hallii</i>, the composition is largely shared with other northern mixedgrass prairie groups. Further review is needed based on quantitative analyses of these types.","","Group","2.B.2.Nb.3.d","2.B.2.Nb.5.d","C02","Shrub & Herb Vegetation","S18","Temperate & Boreal Grassland & Shrubland","F012","Temperate Grassland & Shrubland","2.B.2.Nb","D023","Central North American Grassland & Shrubland","CM332","","Great Plains Rough Fescue Prairie","Great Plains Rough Fescue Prairie","","Prairies de ftuque de Hall des Grandes Plaines","","G1G3","G2","2022-01-26","NNR","NNR","","CA,US","AB, MB, ON, SK","MT, ND","","","Coupland, R.

Northern fescue prairie is primarily found in Alberta and Saskatchewan, less commonly in Manitoba, with a few occurrences in North Dakota and Montana. The type occurs as extensive grasslands south of the limit of tree growth in the west-central prairies, and also forms the grassland patches that occur between forest/woodland groves in this part of the Parkland CNVC vegetation zone. Natural stands are dense, mid-height (approximately 20-40 cm tall), and strongly dominated by plains rough fescue. Other common graminoids include <i>Elymus lanceolatus, Elymus trachycaulus, Avenula hookeri, Hesperostipa comata, Hesperostipa curtiseta, Koeleria macrantha, Muhlenbergia richardsonis, Pascopyrum smithii</i>, and upland sedges such as <i>Carex obtusata, Carex duriuscula</i>, and <i>Carex inops</i>. A variety of forbs and shrubs occur but may be restricted in abundance by the dense grass. They include <i>Symphyotrichum falcatum, Galium boreale, Achillea millefolium, Artemisia ludoviciana</i>, and <i>Cerastium arvense</i>. <i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i> and <i>Rosa arkansana</i> are common shrub species but may not be readily visible because of the tall growth of the <i>Festuca hallii</i>. Other shrubs that may be present include <i>Rosa woodsii, Artemisia frigida, Amelanchier alnifolia</i>, and <i>Rosa acicularis</i>. Species composition and abundance can shift dramatically with grazing impacts, changes in fire regime, or invasion by exotic species. This type occurs in a cooler and moister climate than does the mixedgrass prairie to the south. It usually occurs on level to rolling terrain at elevations below 1000 m ASL. Stands may occur in a variety of upland or valley settings. Most stands are on Black or Dark Brown Chernozemic soils with loamy to clayey textures, but may also occur on sandy sites and on Solonetzic soils with an impervious hardpan layer.","","2.B.2.Nb.5.d","","","","","",""

Stands of this alliance are almost exclusively found on sand deposits; a few are on coarse loams. Stands are usually on gentle slopes but can be on flat ground or steep slopes. The soil is sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam, and there is little horizon development. Water penetrates the coarse soil quickly. This results in the upper soil having little available moisture for most of the growing season. Water and wind erosion can be frequent disturbances in this alliance.","","2.B.2.Nb.6.b.Calamovilfa longifolia - Andropogon hallii - Hesperostipa comata Sand Prairie Alliance","G889","","Northern Great Plains Sand Prairie","Northern Great Plains Sand Prairie","",""

The group is characterized by distinctive scrub and herb flora, of eastern tallgrass prairie elements and eastern subboreal elements, with less than 10% tree cover. It is found primarily in an arc along the Niagara Escarpment from northern Lake Michigan across northern Lake Huron and eastern Ontario and northwestern New York State. The climate is humid and subhumid, and sites are centered on areas of glaciated horizontal limestone/dolomite (dolostone) bedrock pavement with a discontinuous thin soil mantle. This group can be divided into two main variants: (1) open grasslands and pavements, with shrubs &lt;25% cover and (2) shrublands, where shrubs are &gt;25%. These two variants are distinguished by the amount of exposed bedrock, the cover of herbaceous plants (mostly grasses and sedges), the cover of shrubs, and the cover of trees (&lt;10% cover).<br /><br />Alvar grasslands are typically dominated by <i>Schizachyrium scoparium, Deschampsia cespitosa, Sporobolus heterolepis, Eleocharis compressa, Carex crawei, Juniperus horizontalis, Carex scirpoidea</i>, and <i>Packera paupercula</i>. Other characteristic grasses and herbs include <i>Sporobolus neglectus, Sporobolus vaginiflorus, Trichostema brachiatum</i>, and <i>Allium schoenoprasum</i>.

In more exposed areas, there is a mosaic of mossy patches and exposed bedrock that is covered with crustose and foliose lichens.<br /><br />In shrubby areas, the dominant shrub is the short to tall shrub <i>Juniperus communis</i>, mixed with <i>Juniperus horizontalis</i> and/or <i>Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda</i>, or a mix of scrub forms of tree species such as <i>Picea glauca, Thuja occidentalis, Larix laricina, Abies balsamea</i>. Mixed among the shrubs are <i>Danthonia spicata, Oligoneuron album, Packera paupercula, Clinopodium arkansanum</i>, and <i>Tetraneuris herbacea</i>. Characteristic tall shrubs (2 to 5 m tall) include scrub forms of trees such as <i>Juniperus virginiana, Thuja occidentalis</i>, and <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i>. Alvars are maintained by associated geologic, hydrologic, and other landscape processes. In particular, most types of alvar tend to flood each spring, then experience moderate to severe drought in summer months. They include open pavement, grassland, and shrubland/woodland types. Alvar communities occur in an ecological matrix with similar bedrock and hydrologically influenced communities. Four key ecological processes influence Great Lakes alvar communities: (1) hydrology and soil moisture regime, (2) fire regime and land-use history, (3) herbivory: browsing by deer and grazing by cattle, and (4) the invasion of exotic plant species.","","2.B.2.Nc.5.a","","","","","",""

Other dominant species include <i>Juncus dudleyi, Geum triflorum</i>, and <i>Antennaria</i> spp. Trees are typically absent or restricted to the periphery, and shrub cover is very low and typically limited to <i>Juniperus horizontalis</i> and <i>Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda</i>. Forb cover is not high and has a lower diversity of species than other alvar types. Alvar shrubland can be divided into several subtypes. These include a prairie shrub subtype dominated by <i>Juniperus horizontalis</i> and <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>, with the dominant grass species <i>Andropogon gerardii, Danthonia spicata</i>, and <i>Festuca hallii</i>. Tree species include <i>Populus tremuloides</i> and <i>Quercus macrocarpa</i>. The boreal shrub subtype contains more <i>Juniperus communis</i> than prairie shrubs, and <i>Viburnum rafinesqueanum</i> and <i>Betula occidentalis</i> are common. <i>Danthonia spicata</i> is the dominant grass. <i>Cladonia</i> species and <i>Pinus banksiana</i> also become dominant. Other shrub types include a mixed prairie/boreal subtype and a boulder/exposed ridge subtype. The moist or wet alvar type (alvar wetland) is dominated by <i>Carex</i> spp., <i>Juncus</i> spp., <i>Eleocharis</i> spp., <i>Deschampsia cespitosa</i>, and mosses. Where bare limestone occurs there is only moss and occasionally <i>Juniperus horizontalis</i> or <i>Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda</i>. Overall it appears that invasives in Manitoba alvars are infrequent at the present time.","","2.B.2.Nc.5.b","","","","","",""

For example, blueberry heaths are dominated by ericaceous shrubs that occur on sites with acidic soils that have been cleared for logging, farming, etc., but can also develop on forest sites with a severe fire or persist for a long time with periodic fire. Another example are the northern and midwestern sandplain grasslands that develop on sandplains that have been cleared and plowed for farming or development, and then abandoned, or they can develop in response to severe fire in native forests, or persist for a long time with periodic fire. A well-studied example are the ""old field"" sand barrens of the upper Midwest, studied at Cedar Creek Natural History Area (Inouye et al. 1987). They are treated here as ""native successional grasslands"" within ~Central Tallgrass Prairie Group (G333)$$, because they are very similar to naturally occurring sand barrens and oak barrens types in the surrounding landscape, within 10-25 years.

They also occur to the east in the central Montana mountain ""islands"" foothills, as well as the Rocky Mountain Front and Big and Little Belt ranges. They also extend along the eastern slopes of the Alberta Rockies. The most important species are cool-season perennial bunchgrasses and forbs (&gt;25% cover), sometimes with a sparse (&lt;10% cover) shrub layer. <i>Festuca campestris</i> and <i>Festuca idahoensis</i> are dominants, and <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i> occurs as a codominant, as well as a diversity of other native grasses. To the north, <i>Danthonia parryi</i> becomes codominant. Forb diversity is typically high in both mesic and dry aspects of this group. A soil crust of lichen covers almost all open soil between clumps of grasses; <i>Cladonia</i> and <i>Peltigera</i> species are the most common lichens. Unvegetated mineral soil is commonly found between clumps of grass and the lichen cover. <i>Festuca campestris</i> is easily eliminated by grazing and does not occur in all areas of this group.<br /><br />This group also includes grasslands commonly known as ""Palouse Prairie."" These northern lower montane and valley grasslands represent a shift in the precipitation regime from summer monsoons and cold snowy winters found in the Southern Rockies to predominantly dry summers and winter precipitation. The Palouse region is characterized by rolling topography composed of loess hills and plains over basalt plains. The climate of this region has warm-hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Annual precipitation is high, 38-76 cm (15-30 inches). The soils are typically deep, well-developed, and old.<br /><br />Outside of the Palouse Prairie region, these grasslands are influenced by shorter summers, colder winters, and young soils derived from recent glacial and alluvial material. In the eastern portion of its range in Montana, winter precipitation is replaced by a huge spring peak in precipitation. Elevations range from 300 to 1650 m, ranging from small meadows to large open parks surrounded by conifers in the lower montane, to extensive foothill and valley grasslands below the lower treeline. Many of these valleys may have been primarily sage-steppe with patches of grassland in the past, but because of land-use history post-settlement (herbicide, grazing, fire suppression, pasturing, etc.), they have been converted to grassland-dominated areas. Soils are relatively deep, fine-textured, often with coarse fragments, and non-saline, often with a microphytic crust.<br /><br />In Alberta, this group occurs along the lower and eastern flanks of the Foothills Geologic Belt, primarily in the Foothills Fescue Grassland and Foothills Parkland Natural subregions. Glaciation and bedrock topography in combination result in a complex physiography from sloping lower foothills to hummocky to rolling uplands, mainly on glacial till, with significant lacustrine materials in valleys. Elevation ranges from 500 to 1525 m. At upper elevations, stands may be small-patch grasslands on southern slopes between <i>Populus tremuloides</i> woodlands or <i>Salix bebbiana</i> shrublands becoming quite extensive on moister sites at lower elevation. Soils are deep, usually Black Chernozems.","","2.B.2.Nf.2.c","","","","","",""

A diverse ground moss and lichen layer can cover much of the space between vascular plants, although it can be displaced with ground disturbance. This alliance occurs in remnants of the Palouse Prairie of southeastern Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Stands occur on ridgetops or on flat to concave surfaces on the middle or upper third of the slope between 1580-1935 m elevation. Slopes range from flat to 110%, and stands can be found on all aspects.

Many occurrences are small-patch in spatial character, and are often found in mosaics with woodlands, more dense shrublands, or just below alpine communities. These are typically lush meadows dominated by a diversity of tall forbs, with grasses intermingled in many of them. The vegetation is typically forb-rich, with forbs often contributing more to overall herbaceous cover than graminoids. However, some stands are composed of dense grasslands, these often being taxa with relatively broad and soft blades, such as <i>Elymus trachycaulus, Festuca viridula</i>, and <i>Phleum alpinum</i>, but where the moist habitat promotes a rich forb component. Important taxa includes <i>Achillea millefolium, Balsamorhiza sagittata, Rudbeckia occidentalis, Thalictrum occidentale, Valeriana sitchensis, Xerophyllum tenax</i>, and numerous species of Asteraceae, <i>Campanula, Erigeron, Ligusticum, Lomatium, Lupinus, Mertensia, Phlox, Penstemon, Solidago</i>, and <i>Wyethia</i>. Important graminoids include <i>Deschampsia cespitosa, Koeleria macrantha, Luzula glabrata</i>, perennial <i>Bromus</i> spp., and a number of <i>Carex</i> species. In the Cascades, this group includes <i>Festuca viridula</i> meadows. <i>Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda</i> and <i>Symphoricarpos</i> spp. are occasional but not abundant. In the Sierra Nevada <i>Calamagrostis breweri, Carex filifolia, Carex straminiformis, Juncus drummondii, Oreostemma alpigenum, Solidago canadensis</i>, and <i>Trisetum spicatum</i> may dominate stands with diagnostics forbs <i>Oreostemma alpigenum</i>, and <i>Solidago canadensis</i>. Dwarf-shrubs such as <i>Vaccinium cespitosum</i> may have significant cover. Burrowing mammals can increase the forb diversity. This group is typically found above 2000 m in elevation in the southern part of its range and above 600 m in the northern part. These upland communities occur on gentle to moderate-gradient slopes and relatively moist habitats. The soils are typically seasonally moist to saturated in the spring but, if so, will dry out later in the growing season.

The group includes many areas that are inland and do not have coastal exposure. Due to shallow soils, steep slopes, sunny aspect, and/or upper slope position, these sites are dry and marginal for tree establishment and growth except in favorable microsites. Fires, both lightning-ignited and those ignited by Native Americans, undoubtedly at least occasionally burn all these sites. Because of this fire history, the extent of this group has declined locally through tree invasion and growth, as areas formerly maintained as herbaceous by burning have filled in with trees.

On the mainland, it is often a narrow zone between the high-tide line and the upland forest; this zone becomes wider with increasing maritime influence, e.g., on some islands. The substrate is sand flats and beaches, or sandy with broken rock, ranging from cobbles to gravels, sometimes with a shallow soil layer. Tree growth is prevented by extreme exposure to wind, salt spray, and fog. Cover is patchy herbs with an occasional shrub. On cobble beaches, where storm waves create an unstable substrate, vascular plant cover is low, with typical species including <i>Cakile edentula ssp. edentula, Calystegia sepium, Chamaesyce polygonifolia, Chenopodium album, Elymus repens, Galeopsis bifida, Honckenya peploides ssp. diffusa, Lathyrus japonicus, Raphanus raphanistrum, Rumex crispus, Salsola kali, Sisymbrium altissimum, Solanum dulcamara</i>, and <i>Solidago sempervirens</i>. <i>Mertensia maritima</i> is an infrequent but diagnostic species of cobble beaches. Open rocky shore habitats are characterized by sparse (<25%) cover of salt-tolerant herbs such as <i>Argentina egedii ssp. groenlandica, Atriplex prostrata, Glaux maritima, Limonium carolinianum, Puccinellia maritima, Salicornia depressa, Spergularia salina</i>, and <i>Suaeda maritima</i>.

It often occurs within dunal complexes but can also occur on coastal shorelines, on sandy former lake embayments, and sandplains. Component plant communities vary from sparsely vegetated to communities dominated by a combination of grasses, shrubs, and scattered trees, depending on the degree of sand deposition, sand erosion, and distance from the lake. Depositional areas, where Great Lakes beachgrass foredunes and coastal beaches are found, are dominated by <i>Ammophila breviligulata</i> (or in the eastern part of the range <i>Ammophila champlainensis</i>). Erosional areas, such as slacks in blowouts and dunefields, may be dominated by <i>Calamovilfa longifolia</i>, and stabilized areas by <i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>. Low evergreen shrubs (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Juniperus communis, Juniperus horizontalis</i>) occupy dune crests and also the ground layer in the savanna edge of dunes and sandplains. Deciduous shrubs are dominant in many areas and include <i>Prunus pumila, Salix cordata</i>, and <i>Salix myricoides</i>. <i>Populus deltoides</i> can form an open overstory canopy, while <i>Juniperus communis, Juniperus horizontalis, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>, and <i>Koeleria macrantha</i> form a scattered ground layer along low dunefields and sandplains with more advanced plant succession that often follows the first open dunes and swales. Due to lakeshore proximity, heavy winds commonly affect this group.","","2.B.4.Na.2.e","","","","","",""

Climates are cold enough to allow the rate of peat accumulation to exceed its decomposition. They contain a continuous (&gt;80% cover) layer of <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses (sometimes submerged in bog pools), to depths exceeding 40 cm, with ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and thin-leaved graminoids &gt;25% cover. Scrub trees &lt;2 m may be common, but trees &gt;5 m are &lt;10% cover. Acidic peatlands range from strictly ombrotrophic bog (isolated from groundwater, precipitation fed) to weakly minerotrophic poor fen. They occur in extensive areas of low flats, or develop in open or closed, relatively shallow basins with nutrient-poor and acidic conditions. Many occur in association with larger lakes or streams. Some occur as kettlehole fens (usually called kettlehole ""bogs"") associated with eskers or other glacial deposits. Poor fens often develop adjacent to open water and may form a floating mat over water. The surface morphology of a bog may be more-or-less level, domed, or eccentric, but typically is above the water table. As peat accumulates, ridges may form, which can be relatively dry compared to the flat areas. Secondary bog pools (schlenke) may be present in the raised portions of the peatlands. <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses play a key role in these systems because they trap base cations, causing the organic soils to acidify, and they retain moisture, thus slowing the decomposition rate and promoting peat accumulation. Species diversity is low. Dwarf-shrubs include <i>Chamaedaphne calyculata, Ledum groenlandicum, Kalmia polifolia, Andromeda polifolia, Vaccinium oxycoccos, Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>, occasionally <i>Gaultheria hispidula</i> or <i>Betula pumila</i>. Rarely, tall ericaceous shrubs such as <i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i> are dominant. Common sedges include <i>Carex oligosperma, Carex chordorrhiza, Carex magellanica </i>ssp<i>. irrigua, Carex limosa</i>, and <i>Carex lasiocarpa</i>. Other herbs include <i>Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum virginicum, Drosera rotundifolia, Menyanthes trifoliata, Sarracenia purpurea</i>, and <i>Scheuchzeria palustris</i>. When present, stunted <i>Picea mariana</i> and <i>Larix laricina</i> are the dominant trees. Dominant mosses include <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> and <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i>, and less commonly <i>Sphagnum angustifolium. Pleurozium schreberi</i> can be common on raised mats.<br /><br />In the Atlantic region, from Labrador to Downeast Maine, acidic peatlands take on somewhat different characteristics. In basins, they develop raised plateaus with undulating sedge and dwarf-shrub vegetation. <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i> may form sedge lawns on the raised plateau. The system may also occur as ""blanket bogs"" over a sloping rocky substrate in extreme maritime settings; here, dwarf-shrubs and <i>Sphagnum</i> are the dominant cover. Species characteristic of this maritime setting include <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i>. Typical bog heaths such as <i>Kalmia angustifolia, Kalmia polifolia, Gaylussacia baccata, Ledum groenlandicum</i>, and <i>Gaylussacia dumosa</i> are also present. Morphological characteristics and certain coastal species distinguish these from more inland acidic peatlands.","","2.C.2.Na.1.d","","","","","",""

It has an ombrotrophic nutrient regime and occurs in both coastal bogs and as thin peat blankets over sloping bedrock (3-10% slope); the two settings may be contiguous. Most known sites are within 24 km (15 miles) of the ocean. Peat accumulation isolates this community from groundwater influence. Conditions are highly acidic, with pH usually below 5.0. There are two subtypes of this alliance. The dwarf-shrub bog contains low or matted dwarf-shrubs, often less than 20 cm tall; trees and tall shrubs are absent or at most widely scattered. Herbs are likewise sparse. The bryoid layer is essentially continuous and forms the vegetation substrate. <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and <i>Gaylussacia dumosa</i>, often with scattered <i>Juniperus communis</i>, are the diagnostic shrubs; other bog ericads are often present, such as <i>Chamaedaphne calyculata, Kalmia angustifolia, Kalmia polifolia, Ledum groenlandicum, Rhododendron canadense</i>, and <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>. <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> is often present. Characteristic herbs include <i>Calopogon tuberosus, Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum var. spissum, Rhynchospora alba, Sarracenia purpurea, Solidago uliginosa, Trichophorum cespitosum</i>, and <i>Trientalis borealis</i>. The bryophyte layer is a carpet of primarily <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i>, with other species including <i>Sphagnum rubellum, Sphagnum affine, Sphagnum flavicomans, Sphagnum magellanicum</i>, and lichens of the genus <i>Cladonia</i> (<i>Cladonia rangiferina, Cladonia arbuscula</i>, and others). The dwarf-shrubs <i>Empetrum nigrum, Gaylussacia dumosa</i>, and <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i>, the sedge <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i>, and the moss <i>Sphagnum affine</i> differentiate this subtype.<br /><br />The sedge-dominated form occurs on the central, raised, relatively drier portions of maritime peatlands. The substrate is <i>Sphagnum</i> peat, usually saturated, and is acidic, around pH 4.5. Trees and shrubs are absent to sparse; dwarf-shrub cover is variable, from sparse to (rarely) over 80%. Even where dwarf-shrubs are abundant, however, their short stature allows the sedge lawns to visually dominate the vegetation. The bryoid layer is continuous. The peatland ""lawns"" are characterized by abundant <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i>. Scattered low shrubs include <i>Gaylussacia dumosa</i> and <i>Chamaedaphne calyculata</i>, as well as occasional <i>Andromeda polifolia var. glaucophylla, Empetrum nigrum, Kalmia angustifolia, Kalmia polifolia, Ledum groenlandicum, Rubus chamaemorus</i>, and <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i>. Other associates include <i>Arethusa bulbosa, Calopogon tuberosus, Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum var. spissum</i>, and <i>Solidago uliginosa</i>. The bryophyte layer is dominated by <i>Sphagnum rubellum</i> and <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i>, as well as <i>Sphagnum magellanicum</i> and <i>Sphagnum flavicomans</i>. Fruticose lichens characterize and distinguish this subtype and include <i>Cladonia rangiferina, Cladonia mitis, Cladonia arbuscula, Cladonia terrae-novae, Cladonia uncialis</i>, and <i>Cladonia crispata</i>. Diagnostic characters are its location in maritime peatlands and the relative abundance of <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i> with other peatland plants. <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> are also good indicators.","","2.C.2.Na.1.d.Gaylussacia spp. / Trichophorum cespitosum / Sphagnum spp. Maritime Acidic Graminoid Bog & Fen Alliance","G1172","","Eastern North American Boreal-Subboreal Bog & Acidic Fen","Eastern North American Boreal-Subboreal Bog & Acidic Fen","",""

The surrounding landscape may be ringed with other wetland systems, e.g., riparian shrublands, or a variety of upland systems from grasslands to forests. This group is confined to specific environments defined by groundwater discharge, soil chemistry, and peat accumulation of at least 40 cm. Fens form at low points in the landscape or on slopes where groundwater intercepts the soil surface. Groundwater inflows maintain a fairly constant water level year-round, with water at or near the surface most of the time. Acidic fens are restricted to areas where bedrock is noncalcareous (e.g., sandstone, basalt, quartzite, granite). Constant high water levels and cold winter temperatures lead to accumulation of organic material. In addition to peat accumulation and perennially saturated soils, soil chemistry is acidic and nutrients are low. Iron fens are the exception where the pH is low (acidic) but nutrients are high.","","2.C.2.Na.1.f","","","","","",""

There is a discontinuous to absent layer of <i>Sphagnum</i> peatmoss (&lt;80% cover), with brown mosses (<i>Calliergon, Campylium, Drepanocladus, Tomentypnum</i>) present to dominant. Broad-leaved non-ericaceous shrubs (<i>Alnus incana, Betula glandulosa, Betula pumila, Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda, Myrica gale, Salix</i> spp.) exceed cover of ericaceous shrubs, although some shore fens may be dominated by <i>Chamaedaphne calyculata</i>. Thin-leaved graminoids include <i>Carex interior, Carex lasiocarpa, Carex limosa, Carex livida, Eriophorum viridicarinatum, Muhlenbergia glomerata</i>, and <i>Trichophorum alpinum</i>. In the tree layer, <i>Picea mariana</i> is rare to absent and <i>Larix laricina</i> is variable. Minerotrophic <i>Sphagnum</i> dominates the substrate among medium fens, but brown mosses become increasingly common under richer conditions. <i>Campylium stellatum</i> is an indicator brown moss bryophyte.","","2.C.2.Na.2.d","","","","","",""

Shrubs include <i>Betula glandulosa</i> and several <i>Salix</i> spp. Fens form at low points in the landscape or on slopes where groundwater intercepts the soil surface. Groundwater inflows maintain a fairly constant water level year-round, with water at or near the surface most of the time. Constant high water levels and cold winter temperatures lead to accumulation of organic material. In addition to peat accumulation and perennially saturated soils, soil chemistry is alkaline to neutral with nutrients high in base cations. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) are usually still limiting plant growth in rich fens. Rich fens are strongly influenced by geology and occur where limestone, dolostone, marble or where glacially-derived materials are calcareous. The surrounding landscape may be ringed with other wetland systems, e.g., riparian shrublands, or a variety of upland systems from grasslands to forests.","","2.C.2.Na.2.f","","","","","",""

It can be dominated by any one or a number of conifer species (<i>Callitropsis nootkatensis, Picea sitchensis, Pinus contorta var. contorta, Tsuga heterophylla</i>, and/or <i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>) that are capable of growing on saturated or seasonally flooded soils. Overstory is often less than 50% cover, but shrub understory can have high cover. Common shrubs include <i>Elliottia pyroliflora, Gaultheria shallon</i> (southern portion of the Alaska distribution only), and <i>Vaccinium ovalifolium</i>. Common understory species include <i>Carex anthoxanthea, Carex pluriflora, Carex stylosa, Eriophorum</i> spp., <i>Lysichiton americanus, Nephrophyllidium crista-galli, Phegopteris connectilis, Thelypteris quelpaertensis, Trichophorum cespitosum</i>, and <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. Treed bogs and fens are common in southeastern Alaska, less so farther south. Forest bogs and fens can be mostly small-patch in size, but can be extensive in the Pacific Northwest. This group is found on poorly drained soils, ranging from organic veneers over wet mineral soils to deeper organics peaty soils; the peat is mostly deep, mossy peat, but can include woody peat. The peat may also be shallow over rock. The water source is stagnant or slowly moving acidic groundwater or direct precipitation.","","2.C.2.Na.3.c","","","","","",""

They are mostly semipermanently flooded, but some marshes have seasonal hydrologic flooding. Water is on or above the surface for most of the growing season. A consistent source of freshwater is essential to the function of these communities. Soils are muck or mineral or muck over a mineral soil, and water is high-nutrient. It is often found along the borders of ponds, lakes or reservoirs that have more open water. Some occurrences are interdunal wetlands in wind deflation areas, where sands are scoured down to the water table. The water table may be perched over an impermeable layer of caliche or clay or, in the case of the Great Sand Dunes of Colorado, a geologic dike that creates a closed basin that traps water.","","2.C.4.Nb.1.a","","","","","",""

Due to drawdown characteristics, vernal pools typically form concentric rings of similar vegetation. Given their relative isolation in upland-dominated landscapes, many endemic plant species are found in vernal pools. Characteristic species are predominantly annual and diverse. Northern scabland vernal pools share about a third of the species found in northern California vernal pools, but they do not share many of the more common dominant species. Currently very little quantitative plot data have been made available. <i>Eryngium petiolatum</i> and <i>Plagiobothrys figuratus</i> are known dominants that do not occur in California; however, it is assumed many more species could be used to differentiate between these similar groups. Characteristic species in these communities include <i>Callitriche marginata, Callitriche</i> spp., <i>Camissonia tanacetifolia, Deschampsia danthonioides, Downingia elegans, Elatine</i> spp., <i>Eleocharis</i> spp., <i>Epilobium densiflorum, Eryngium petiolatum, Eryngium vaseyi, Grindelia nana, Isoetes orcuttii, Juncus uncialis, Myosurus minimus, Navarretia leucocephala ssp. diffusa, Pilularia americana, Plagiobothrys</i> spp., <i>Plagiobothrys figuratus, Plagiobothrys scouleri, Polyctenium williamsiae, Polygonum polygaloides ssp. confertiflorum, Polygonum polygaloides ssp. polygaloides, Psilocarphus brevissimus, Psilocarphus elatior, Psilocarphus oregonus, Trifolium cyathiferum, Triteleia hyacinthina</i>, and <i>Veronica peregrina</i>.

Hardpan vernal pools occur on soils with an indurated clay or cemented (Si or Fe) layer that retains water inputs throughout some portion of the spring, and that typically dry down completely into early summer months. In the Sand Juan and Gulf islands, they are created in small depressions in bedrock. Thus this group only occurs where there is hummocky micro-relief. These wetlands tend to be acidic wetlands. On the Columbia Plateau many pools are located on massive basalt flows, andesite or rhyodacite caprock. Inundation is highly irregular, sometimes not occurring for several years. Depressions usually (but not always) fill with water during winter and spring. They are generally dry again within nine months, though in exceptional times they can remain inundated for two years in a row. Water is from rainfall and snowmelt in relatively small closed basins, on average probably no more than 5-15 times the area of the ponds themselves. Pools are depressions with no outflows. Soils when present are typically silty clay, sometimes with sandy margins. Ponds range from very small (3 sqm) to large depressions (1600 sqm).","","2.C.4.Nb.3.b","","","","","",""

Dominant shrubs include <i>Acer glabrum, Artemisia cana, Artemisia cana ssp. bolanderi, Artemisia cana ssp. viscidula, Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata, Cornus sericea, Crataegus douglasii, Crataegus rivularis, Dasiphora fruticosa ssp. floribunda, Forestiera pubescens, Oplopanax horridus, Philadelphus lewisii, Prunus virginiana, Rhus trilobata, Rosa nutkana, Rosa woodsii, Salix exigua, Salix irrorata, Salix melanopsis, Shepherdia argentea</i>, and <i>Symphoricarpos</i> spp. Herbaceous layers are often dominated by <i>Athyrium filix-femina, Carex flava, Carex</i> spp., <i>Elymus trachycaulus, Equisetum arvense, Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca idahoensis, Galium triflorum, Glyceria striata, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Heracleum maximum, Iris missouriensis, Juncus arcticus ssp. littoralis, Juncus</i> spp., <i>Leymus cinereus, Maianthemum stellatum, Muhlenbergia filiformis, Muhlenbergia richardsonis, Pascopyrum smithii, Poa cusickii</i>, and <i>Poa secunda</i>. Introduced forage species such as <i>Agrostis stolonifera, Poa pratensis, Phleum pratense</i>, and the invasive annual <i>Bromus tectorum</i> are often present in disturbed stands. Streams are permanent, intermittent and ephemeral. Stands occur in steep-sided canyons or in broad flat valleys. They can be large, wide occurrences on mid-channel islands in larger rivers or narrow bands on small, rocky canyon tributaries and well-drained benches. They also are typically found in backwater channels and other perennially wet but less scoured sites, such as floodplain swales and irrigation ditches, and they can occur in depressional wetlands and non-alkaline playas. Stands may also occur on upper benches away from active channel movement. Willow-dominated shrublands require flooding and bare gravels for reestablishment. Stands are maintained by annual flooding and hydric soils throughout the growing season. Sites are subject to temporary flooding during spring runoff. The water table is often just below the ground surface. Occurrences are found within the flood zone of rivers, on islands, sand or cobble bars, and immediate streambanks and upper benches, and occasionally on hillslope springs. This group occurs throughout the Rocky Mountain and Colorado Plateau regions from approximately 780 to 1850 m (2560-6000 feet) in elevation, around the edges and between the mountain ranges of the Great Basin and along the lower eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada at about 1220 m (4000 feet) in elevation, at lowland and montane elevations in the Columbia Plateau, on the periphery of the mountains surrounding the Columbia River Basin, and along major tributaries and the main stem of the Columbia at relatively low elevations. It also occurs in the foothills of the northern Rocky Mountains and the east slopes of the Cascades in the lower montane and foothill zones. Climate is generally semi-arid.","","2.C.4.Nb.5.a","","","","","",""

Wet meadows occur in open wet depressions, basins and flats with low-velocity surface and subsurface flows. They can be large meadows in montane or subalpine valleys, or occur as narrow strips bordering ponds, lakes and streams, and along toeslope seeps. They are typically found on flat areas or gentle slopes, but may also occur on subirrigated sites with slopes up to 10%. In alpine regions, sites typically are small depressions located below late-melting snow patches. Sites are usually seasonally wet, often drying by late summer, and many occur in a tension zone between perennial wetlands and uplands, where water tables fluctuate in response to long-term climatic cycles. They may have surface water for part of the year, but depths rarely exceed a few centimeters. Wet meadows can be tightly associated with snowmelt and typically are not subjected to high velocity disturbance, but can be flooded by slow-moving waters. Soils are mostly mineral and show typical hydric soil characteristics such as low chroma and redoximorphic features; some areas may have high organic content as inclusions or pockets. Vegetation of this group can manifest as a mosaic of several plant associations, or be a monotypic stand of a single association which is dominated by graminoids or forbs.","","2.C.4.Nb.5.b","","","","","",""

They range in elevation from upper subalpine to alpine (1500-3600 m) depending on latitude. These types occur as large meadows in subalpine valleys, as narrow strips bordering ponds, lakes and streams, and along toeslope seeps. They are typically found on flat areas or gentle slopes, but may also occur on subirrigated sites with slopes up to 10%. In alpine regions, sites typically are small depressions located below late-melting snow patches or on snowbeds. Soils of this group are mineral or with a thin (<40 cm) organic layer over mineral layers (aka not peatland). Soils show hydric soil characteristics, including high organic content and/or low chroma and redoximorphic features. This group often occurs as a mosaic of several plant associations, often dominated by graminoids such as <i>Carex illota, Carex lachenalii, Carex nigricans, Carex vernacula, Deschampsia cespitosa, Juncus drummondii</i>, and forbs <i>Caltha leptosepala, Trollius laxus, Phippsia algida, Rorippa alpina, Sibbaldia procumbens</i>, and <i>Trifolium parryi</i>. Often scattered to moderately dense dwarf-shrubs are present, especially <i>Dasiphora, Kalmia, Salix</i> or <i>Vaccinium</i>, which when present form alpine dwarf-shrublands. Wet meadows are tightly associated with snowmelt and typically not subjected to high disturbance events such as flooding.","","2.C.4.Nb.5.c","","","","","",""

They can be large meadows in montane or subalpine valleys, or occur as narrow strips bordering ponds, lakes, and streams, and along toeslope seeps. They are typically found on flat areas or gentle slopes, but may also occur on subirrigated sites with slopes up to 10%. Sites are usually seasonally wet, often drying by late summer, and many occur in a tension zone between perennial wetlands and uplands, where water tables fluctuate in response to long-term climatic cycles. They may have surface water for part of the year, but depths rarely exceed a few centimeters. Soils are mostly mineral and show typical hydric soil characteristics such as low chroma and redoximorphic features; some areas may have high organic content as inclusions or pockets.

The soils are generally saturated throughout the growing season and experience some degree of seasonal flooding. In some situations, the majority of the woody vegetation grows on drier hummocks above permanent standing water. The soils vary from mineral soils with a high organic content in the driest swamps to deep organic muck or peat in some of the wettest swamps.","","2.C.4.Nd.1.d.Alnus incana Shrub Swamp Alliance","G904","","Laurentian-Acadian Wet Meadow & Shrub Swamp","Laurentian-Acadian Wet Meadow & Shrub Swamp","",""

This vegetation is primarily dominated by tall and short forbs, as well as by graminoids and <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses in some associations. These seepage-fed wetlands are found on gentle slopes. Examples are linear, non-peaty, non-sphagnous, often rocky, groundwater slope wetlands that are embedded in an upland forest setting. Some smaller examples may be nearly or fully shaded by overhanging trees rooted in the adjacent forest, but others are open. Stands of this group are dominated by a wetland flora, but with a lack of species characteristic of floodplains and true bogs (some bog-related species may occasionally be present). Trees may be present on the edges of stands, or often overhanging, but are not characteristic. Shrub species are typically sparse and most typically mesophytic, rather than obligate wetland species. They may form dense zones around the edge but are not characteristic. The herb layer is generally well-developed, and is usually dominated either by characteristic forbs such as <i>Chelone</i> spp., <i>Impatiens capensis, Impatiens pallida, Rudbeckia laciniata</i>, and <i>Symplocarpus foetidus</i>, and/or with presence of <i>Carex</i> spp. and other graminoids, including <i>Eriophorum virginicum</i> and <i>Glyceria striata</i>.

They occur as pockets or narrow linear patches within northern forests where seepage waters create saturated and mineral-rich conditions. Streamheads and lower slopes are typical settings, and the ground surface is usually gently sloping. Though generally shaded by the overhanging forest canopy, this association is defined by the herbaceous vegetation which is distinctly different from the herb and shrub layers in the surrounding forest. Shrub cover is generally low, and herb cover is lush (typically in the range of 60-85%). Bryophytes may be present but are often patchy. Herb composition is variable depending on the nutrient status of the soil and seepage water. Ferns, such as <i>Onoclea sensibilis, Athyrium filix-femina</i>, and <i>Matteuccia struthiopteris</i>, may be prominent. <i>Impatiens capensis</i> and <i>Arisaema triphyllum</i> are typical forb species.

Many other graminoid species are common in these depressions. Some associations may include a zone dominated by taller graminoids, including <i>Saccharum</i> spp. or <i>Scirpus cyperinus</i>. Many species are annual or short-lived perennial plants. They persist for years in the seedbank until the hydrologic conditions are right for germination. Thus, species composition of particular stands may change from year to year. In interior stations of this alliance, many of these seedbank plants are species significantly disjunct from their main range on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. There are two major vegetation zones that occur in this environment: Zone 1 is a seasonally flooded zone of sparse cover by graminoids; and Zone 2 is a saturated zone of dense graminoid cover. These ponds have a pronounced seasonal fluctuation in water level, filling in the winter and drying in the summer. The water table fluctuates seasonally and yearly. It is highest in late winter and spring, and during years of high precipitation. The soils are derived mainly from sand, which is poor in nutrients and is acidic, with pH ranging from 4.4-7.0.

The depressions are regularly to irregularly flooded by high tides, but as the water evaporates during low tide, the salinity concentration increases forming ""salt pannes."" Formation of the pannes may result from ice scouring, rafting flotsam, peat compaction, mosquito ditch levees, or erosion of tidal creek banks, which create small, sparsely vegetated to unvegetated impoundments.

Other species include <i>Bassia scoparia, Grindelia squarrosa</i> (in the northern portion of this alliance's range), <i>Hordeum jubatum, Iva annua, Pascopyrum smithii</i> (on less saline stands), <i>Poa arida, Puccinellia nuttalliana</i> (in the north), <i>Salicornia rubra</i> (on more saline stands), <i>Bolboschoenus maritimus, Sporobolus airoides, Suaeda calceoliformis</i> (on more saline stands). Widely scattered low shrubs, especially <i>Atriplex patula</i> and <i>Sarcobatus vermiculatus</i>, can be found on sites in the western and central Great Plains. Trees are not found. Stands of this alliance are found in depressions and along the margins of saline lakes and ponds. Most of the stands are flooded or saturated for a few weeks in the spring and after heavy rains; some have water present for most of the growing season. The soils range from sand to clay and from moderately well-drained to poorly drained. Most are deep and moderately to strongly saline. Stands that have good drainage in the surface soils usually have a deeper impermeable or slowly permeable layer that allows retention of water. Fires which spread from upland prairies may have moved through the more dense stands, but many stands did not have sufficient vegetation to support fires.","","2.C.5.Nc.1.c.Distichlis spicata - Hordeum jubatum Wet Meadow Alliance","G984","","Great Plains Saline Wet Meadow & Marsh","Great Plains Saline Wet Meadow & Marsh","",""

Many are associated with hot and cold springs, located in basins with internal drainage. Soils are alkaline to saline clays with hardpans. Seasonal drying exposes mudflats colonized by annual wetland vegetation. Water is prevented from percolating through the soil by an impermeable soil subhorizon and is left to evaporate. Soil salinity varies greatly with soil moisture and greatly affects species composition. During exceptionally wet years, increased precipitation can dilute soil salt concentrations which may allow less salt-tolerant species to become established or more abundant.

The vegetation is generally composed of low-growing perennial forbs and graminoids. On fell-field sites, total vegetation cover ranges from sparse to moderate cover dominated by cushion plants, whereas on turf sites, it ranges from open to moderately dense or dense cover dominated by graminoids or a mixture of graminoids and forbs (especially cushion plants). The graminoids are typically rhizomatous, sod-forming sedges such as <i>Carex elynoides, Carex helleri, Carex scirpoidea, Carex siccata, Carex nardina, Carex rupestris, Kobresia myosuroides</i>, and <i>Linanthus pungens</i>. Common fell-field species include <i>Arenaria capillaris, Erigeron pygmaeus, Eriogonum incanum, Geum rossii, Hulsea algida, Minuartia obtusiloba, Myosotis asiatica, Paronychia pulvinata, Phacelia hastata var. compacta, Phlox covillei, Phlox pulvinata, Saxifraga tolmiei, Silene acaulis, Trifolium dasyphyllum</i>, and <i>Trifolium parryi</i>. Many other graminoids, forbs, and prostrate shrubs can also be found, including <i>Calamagrostis purpurascens, Deschampsia cespitosa, Dryas octopetala, Ericameria discoidea, Festuca brachyphylla, Festuca idahoensis, Leucopoa kingii, Luzula spicata, Poa arctica, Poa glauca, Poa secunda</i> (Great Basin), <i>Podistera nevadensis, Polygonum bistortoides, Saxifraga</i> spp., <i>Selaginella densa</i>, and <i>Solidago</i> spp. Fell-fields are usually found within or adjacent to alpine dry turf with many of the same prostrate and mat-forming plants found in both, frequently with broad transition zones. Great Basin alpine areas tend to be drier with smaller turf patches and include some species common in desert scrub such as <i>Elymus elymoides</i> and <i>Poa secunda</i>. Vegetation in these areas is controlled by snow retention, wind desiccation, permafrost, and a short growing season. Fell-fields are typically free of snow during the winter as they are found on ridgetops, upper slopes and exposed saddles, whereas dry turf is found on gentle to moderate slopes, flat ridges, valleys, and basins where the soil has become relatively stabilized and the water supply is more-or-less constant. Fell-field substrates are generally shallow, stony, low in organic matter, and poorly developed with wind deflation often resulting in a gravelly pavement. Alpine turf sites have deeper, more developed soils, although there may be moderately high cover of cobbles and boulders present. Although alpine dry turf may form the matrix or large patches of the alpine zone, it typically intermingles with alpine bedrock and scree, ice field, fell-field, alpine dwarf-shrubland, and alpine/subalpine wet meadow systems.","","4.B.1.Nb.2.b","","","","","",""

Vegetation in these areas is controlled by snow retention, wind desiccation, permafrost, and a short growing season. Alpine turf sites have deeper, more developed soils than fell-fields, although there may be moderately high cover of cobbles and boulders present.","","4.B.1.Nb.2.b.Carex elynoides - Carex rupestris - Kobresia myosuroides Rocky Mountain Alpine Turf Alliance","G314","","Rocky Mountain-Sierran Alpine Turf & Fell-field","Rocky Mountain-Sierran Alpine Turf & Fell-field","",""

Stands are located on lee sides of ridges, saddles, hills and knolls, and rock outcrops and in snow-filled depressions from 2520-3760 m elevation depending on latitude. The snowmelt creates wet-mesic soil conditions that last through most of the growing season and can produce lush vegetation. Snowbed communities often develop in concentric rings with later melting communities in the center. Some sites do not become snow-free until August and have a very short growing season with little time for vegetation to develop.

Vascular plants growing on loose substrates typically have either an extensive shallow root and rhizome system or a massive taproot that anchors the plant. Sparse cover of forbs, grasses, low shrubs and small trees may be present with total vascular plant cover typically less than 25% due to the high cover of exposed rock. Many species are tiny, growing in cracks in rock outcrops. Nonvascular (lichen)-dominated communities are common and may greatly exceed 25% cover in some areas. The lower elevational limit for the alpine zone varies with latitude ranging from near 3660 m (12,000 feet) in the southern extent to near 2286 m (7500 feet) in the northern extent.

The climate is cold and snowy with annual precipitation exceeding 150 cm and a snow-free period of only 3-4 months. These habitats receive abundant (100-250 cm) precipitation and accumulate very heavy snowpacks in winter. These sites are subirrigated by snowmelt during most of the short growing season, although some meadows have soils that dry out by summer's end. Elevations typically range from 1400-2500 m. These communities occur in areas of level or concave to very steep slopes (over 100%) on hills and ridges of glacial topography, with late-lying snow, and subirrigation from surrounding slopes. In exceptionally wet areas, they may occur on convex slopes with better drainage. Soils are moist, but well-drained, strongly acidic, and often with substantial peat layers. Some stands are found on the base of a lobe of soil formed by solifluction. Other are found on deep deposits of volcanic ash, such as thick accumulations of pumice parent material; some occur on andesite.","","4.B.1.Nb.3.a.Phyllodoce empetriformis - Cassiope mertensiana - Vaccinium deliciosum Alpine Dwarf-shrubland Alliance","G317","","North Pacific Alpine-Subalpine Dwarf-shrubland & Heath","North Pacific Alpine-Subalpine Dwarf-shrubland & Heath","",""

The slope shape is usually straight to concave (depressions) where snow lingers, the soil has become relatively stabilized, and the water supply is more-or-less constant. Vegetation in these areas is controlled by snow retention, wind desiccation, permafrost, and a short growing season. The substrate is colluvium, residuum, or glacial till.

Stands included in this alliance have been described from windswept alpine and harsh exposed subalpine areas in the Washington Cascade Range. Elevations range from 1950-2500 m. Sites are very dry fell-fields with large and small exposed rocks. Winter snow cover is generally low because high winds remove it. This vegetation grows between exposed rocks in depressions to gentle slopes. Aspects are southeast- and west-facing, on flat to gentle slopes. Cushion plants are favored because of extreme desiccating conditions. There is significant frost action in the soils that causes stones to be pushed to the surface forming stone stripes and other disturbance such as soil boils. There is little soil material. Parent material is typically andesite on Mount Rainier. Adjacent vegetation in more mesic habitats is alpine turf dominated by graminoids and more mesic forbs.","","4.B.1.Nb.3.b.Minuartia obtusiloba - Lupinus sellulus Cascade Alpine Fell-field Alliance","G320","","North Pacific Alpine-Subalpine Tundra","North Pacific Alpine-Subalpine Tundra","",""

NatureServe, Arlington, VA.","This tundra alliance is defined by tussock-forming sedges often in combination with dwarf- or low shrubs developing over continuous, ice-rich permafrost throughout arctic and subarctic Alaska and Canada.","This tundra alliance is defined by tussock-forming sedges often in combination with dwarf- and low shrubs occurring in the arctic and subarctic regions of Alaska and Canada. The cottongrass <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> is the predominant tussock-former on older landscapes and acidic substrates. Tussock formation may transition to the sedge <i>Carex bigelowii</i> across younger landscapes, disturbance-prone landforms and circumneutral substrates. <i>Carex bigelowii</i> tussock tundra is considered a more productive type relative to mature <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> tussock tundra. <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> tussock tundra is characterized by high constancy of the dwarf-shrub <i>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</i> and the low shrub <i>Betula nana</i>, with the low shrub <i>Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens</i> and the forb <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> indicating the type. By comparison, <i>Carex bigelowii</i> tussock tundra is characterized by high constancy of the dwarf-shrubs <i>Salix reticulata</i>, and <i>Cassiope tetragona</i> with the dwarf-shrub <i>Dryas octopetala</i> indicating the type. Where <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> and <i>Carex bigelowii</i> both contribute to tussock formation, the low shrub <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i> and the dwarf-shrub <i>Empetrum nigrum</i>, and the forb <i>Polygonum bistorta</i>, have high constancy, with the shrub <i>Salix pulchra</i> indicating the type. For tussock tundra occurring in wet areas of Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain, shrub abundance appears to increase on microtopographic highs such as high-centered polygons. On a broader scale, low-shrub cover appears to increase in tussock tundra with increasing slope, with the occurrence of dwarf-shrubs increasing in the subalpine. The presence of continuous, ice-rich permafrost renders sites cold and poorly-drained. Shallow organics in the intertussock hollows are underlain by silty mineral soils.
