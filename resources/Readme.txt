Disclaimer:
- Please review our methods document at https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ajv6BHSXrqqqm4xipeEOQ67IfH77IQ?e=dqM1FO before using EBAR.
- EBAR range data are relatively coarse scale and appropriate for screening and education purposes, but are not intended for all types of applications and analysis.
- The absence of data in any geographic areas does not necessarily mean that a species is not present.
- An ecoshape with a presence value does not necessarily mean that a species is present throughout the entire geographic area.
